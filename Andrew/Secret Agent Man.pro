{c:Intro x 3}

[Em]There's a man [Am]who leads a [Em]life of danger
To [Em]everyone he meets he [B7]stays a stranger
With [Em]every move he [Am]makes, another chance he takes
[Em]Odds are he [Am]won't live to [Em]see tomorrow

{c:Chorus}

Secret [Bm]Agent [Em]Man, Secret [Bm]Agent [Em]Man
They'[C]ve given [B7]you a number and [Em]taken away your name

{c:Intro x 2}

Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Oh, be careful what you say, or you will give yourself away
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow

{c:Chorus}

{c:Intro x 2}

{c:Solo}

{c:Intro x 2}

Swinging on the Riviera one day
And then lying in a Bombay alley next day
Oh, don't you let the wrong words slip, while kissing persuasive lips
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow

{c:Chorus}

{c:Intro x 3}
