[G]When I was [D]young, my [C]Dad would [D]say

[G]Sometimes it [D]seems like [C]yester[D7sus4]day
[D7] [C/E] [D/F#add6] [G] [C] [D7]

[G]Then I'd climb [D]up the [C]closet [D]shelf 
[G]When [D]I was [Em]all by my[C]self 
[G]Grab his hat [D]and fix [C]the br[Dsus4]im 
[D7] [C/E]Pretending [D/F#add6]I was [G]him [G]

[D]No matter how [C]hard I [G]try
[D]No matter how many [C]tears I [G]cry

[D7] [C/E] [D7/F#] [G] [G]

[C]Wind [D7]blows through the [Em]trees [Em/D]
[C]Street lights, they [D7]still shine [Gmaj7]bright [G6]
[C]Moon [D]still looks the [Em]same [Em/D]
but I [Em/C#]miss my [A7]Dad tonight [Dsus4] [D7]

[G]I walked by a [D]Salvation [C]Army st[D]ore

[D7] [C/E]Still trying to [D/F#add6]be like [G]him [G]

[D]No matter how [C]hard I [G]try
