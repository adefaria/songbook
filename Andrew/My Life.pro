[C] [D] [A]

[D]My life's been up and my [A]life's be down
[D]Seems to be spinning like a [A]merry-go-round
[D]Don't wanna get off don't want to [A]slow it down
It's my [C]life, don't slow it [D]down, it's my [A]life

It seems to me that I work all day
Can't seem to find the time to play
Can't get any worse at least it hasn't anyway
It's my life, don't slow it down, it's my life

{soc}
[C]Seems to me we keep a-[D]changing
[C]Not enough to re[D]arrange
[C]I must look further for the [D]answers
[C]Or my life will be the [D]same
Will be the [A]same

[D]Well I've been bad and [A]I've been good

In my [C]life, don't slow it [D]down, cause it's my [A]life
