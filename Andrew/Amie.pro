I can see why [G]you think [D]you be    [A]long to me.  [G]  [D]  [A]
I [A]never tried to [G]make you [D]think, or 
[A]let you *SEE* one thing for your[D]self
But now your   [C]off with someone else & I'm a [D]lone
You see I   [C]thought that I might keep you for my[E] own

{soc}
[A]   Amie       [G]What you *WANNA*  [D]do?
[A]   I  think     [G]I could stay with [D]you for a[Bm]while
Maybe longer if I   [E]do.

[A]  [G]  [D]    [A]   [G]  [D]  [A]

[A]Don't you think the [G]time is [D]right for [A]us to find   [G] [D] [A]      
All the things we [G]thought weren't [D]proper [A]could be right in time
And can you [D]see, Which way we [C]should turn together or a[D]lone
I can [C]never see what's right or what 
[E]is wrong (yeah you take to long to see)

[A]Now it's come to [G]what you [D]want you've [A]had your way  [G] [D] [A]
And all the things you [G]though bef[D]ore just [A]faded into gray
And can you [D]see, That I d[C]on't Know if its you or if its[D] me
If its[C] one of us I'm sure we'll both will[E] see

(won't you look at me and tell me)
