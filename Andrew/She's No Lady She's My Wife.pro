{title:She's No Lady She's My Wife}

{key:G}

She hates my [G7]mama, [Bm7]she hates [Am7]my daddy too[D9].
She loves to [G7]tell me, [Bm7]she hates the [Am7]things I [D9]do.
She loves to [G7]lie beside me, [Am7]almost [Bbmin7]every [Am7]night.
[G7]She no la[D9]dy, she's my [G7]wife.

The preacher asked her, and she said, "I do."
The preacher asked me, she says, â€œYes, He does too!"
The preacher says, "I pronounce you ninety nine to life!
Son, she's no lady she's your wife!"

{c:Chorus}

I can't [C9]remember how I met her
Seems, she's [G7]always been [G#7]hangin' here off[G7] my right arm[C#9],
I can't [C9]remember how I ever
Thought that [Am7]I just couldn't [Bbm7]live without a [Am7]woman's charm[D9]

Now, even though she loves the smell of French perfume 
And even though she walks around in high-heeled shoes 
All I know is I'm the one that pays her price, 
Man, she's no lady, she's my wife.

{c:Lead}

{c:Chorus}

Now she she hates my mama, she hates my daddy too.
She loves to tell me, how much she hates the things I do.
She loves to lie beside me, almost every night.
She's no lady, she's my wife.
