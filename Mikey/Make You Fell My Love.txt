{MAKE YOU FEEL MY LOVE}

[A]When the rain is blowin' [E]in your face[G]
And the whole world is [D]on your case[Dm]
I could offer you a [A]warm embra[B7]ce
To make you [D]feel [A]my love

[A]When the evening shadows and the [E]stars appear[G]
And there is[D] no one there to[Dm] dry your tears
I could hold you for a m[A]illion years[B7]
To make you [D]feel my l[A]ove

[D]I know you haven't made your [A]mind up yet[A7]
But I would [D]never do you [A]wrong[A7]
[D]I've known it from the moment [A]that we met[B7]
No doubt in my mind where [E]you belong.[E7]


[A]I'd go hungry, I'd go b[E]lack and blue[G]
I'd go crawlin' down the [D]avenue[Dm]
No, there's nothin' that I [A]wouldn't do[B7]
To make you [D]feel my [A]love.

break

[D]The storms are raging on the [A]rollin' sea[A7]
And on the [D]highway of re[A]grets[A7]
T[D]he winds of change are blowing w[A]ild and free[B7]
You ain't seen nothin' like [E]me yet.[E7]

[A]I could make you happy, make your [E]dreams come true[G]
There's nothing that I [D]wouldn t do[Dm]  
Go to the ends of the [A]Earth for you[B7]
To make you [D]feel my l[A]ove
