Rise up Singing

I[C] get up in the morning

Hear the work bell warning

Shuffle to my 9 to 5

I[Bb] come home in the evening

I[F] get that feeling

[C]Lord, I start to come alive


[C]Now I don't care about cool conversation (that's right)

I just don't have the time, no

[Bb]All I want is the love my[F] baby [C]keeps my soul in line

[Bb]One of these days I'm gonna [F]rise up, singing with [C]you

[Bb]One of these days I'm gonna [F]rise up, yes it's [C]true


[C]Now I found out about pain and doubt

Long, long time ago

[Bb]But she cured my blindness

[F]With love and kindness


[C]Stays no matter where I go


Now I heard people, all the people talking (that's right)

They just don't understand, no

T[Bb]here's no good reason to [F]go on explaining [C]when a woman's in love with her man


[Bb]One of these days I'm gonna [F]rise up, singing with [C]you

[Bb]One of these days I'm gonna r[F]ise up, yes it's [C]true


Aw, we'll go like this


[C]Ooooo, Ooooo, Ooooooo

[Bb]Ooooo, [F]Ooooo, [C]Ooooooo


Oh baby don't you leave me

Oh no I'll never leave you

I want you here by my side

Cause all I need is to go on living

You keep me satisfied


One of these days I'm gonna rise up, singing with you

One of these days I'm gonna rise up, yes it's true

One of these days I'm gonna rise up, singing with you

One of these days I'm gonna rise up, yes it's true


Ooooo, Ooooo, Ooooooo...
