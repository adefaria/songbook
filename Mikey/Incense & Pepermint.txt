INTRO: [Em] [D]...[Em] [A] [Em] [C]...[Em] [A] [Em] [C]
#1.
[Em]Good sense, [A]innocence, [Em]cripplin' m[C]ankind,
[Em]Dead kings, [A]many things [Em]I can't de[C]fine.
[Em]Occasions, [A]persuasions [E]clutter your m[C]ind.
[Em]Incense and [A]peppermints, the [Em]color of t[C]ime.

CHORUS:
[Em]Who c[Ebm]ares what [D]games we c[A]hoose?
[Em]Little to w[Bm]in, but n[Dm]othing to [A]lose.

#2.
[Em]Incense and [A]peppermints, [Em]meaningless [C]nouns.
[Em]Turn on, tune [A]in, turn your [Em]eyes a[C]round.
[D]Look at your[G]self, [D]look at your[G]self, y[Gbn]eah, y[Gb]eah.
[D]Look at your[G]self, [D]look at your[G]self, y[Gbm]eah, [Gb]yeah, [A]yeah!

#3.
To [Em]divide this [A]cockeyed w[Em]orld in t[C]wo,
[Em]Throw your pride to [A]one side, it's the [Em]least you can [C]do.
[Em]Beatniks and [A]politics, [Em]nothing is n[C]ew.
[Em]A yardstick for [A]lunatics, [Emone point of v[C]iew.

CHORUS:

#4.
Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind,
Dead kings, many things I can't define.
Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind.
Incense and peppermints, the color of time.

CHORUS:

[Em]In..[Bm]cense and [Dm]pepper..[A]mints..
[Em]In..[Bm]cense and [Dm]pepper..[A]mints

 [E]Sha la la...[D]Sha la la...[E]Sha la la...[D]Sha la la(x2)(Fade.)
