Oh, I co[G]uld hide ‘ne[Am]ath the wings
Of the[Bm] bluebird as [C]it sings
The[G] six-o-cl[Em]ock alarm wo[A7]uld ne[D7]ver ring
But it[G] rings an[Am]d I rise
Wash t[Bm]he sleep out [C]of my eyes
My[G] shavi[Em]ng razo[C]r’s c[D7]old and[G] it stings

[Chorus]

C[C]heer u[D]p slee[Bm]py Jean
[C]Oh wha[D]t can [Em]it me[C]an to a

[Verse]

You[G] once thoug[Am]ht of me
As a [Bm]white knight [C]on a steed           
No[G]w you kn[Em]ow how happy
L[A7]ife can[D7] be
And our[G] good times [Am]start and end
Witho[Bm]ut dollar one[C] to spend
Bu[G]t how[Em] much b[C]aby[D7] do we [G]really need
