1 Got him a job sittin' on a fence,                              He ain't done a damn thing since.
  Dance all night with a bottle in his hand,              'Long 'bout dawn give the fiddler a dram.
 
2 Same old man from Kalamazoo,                             He don't give no "yes I do",                                        
   First to the left and then to the right,                   This old mill grinds day and night.
 
3 Same old woman, hangin' out the wash,            Now she's wearin' a mackintosh.
  A-hangin' out the wash in the pourin' rain.         Poor old lady done gone insane.
 
4 Out in the marsh the heron strides.                     Get up early 'fore the sun she rise.
   Morning in the barnyards, fields in the noon,   Fiddle in the evening by the light of the moon. 
 
5 Down came an owl with her head all white,      A lonesome day and a lonesome night,
   Thought I heard a pretty girl say,                            Court all night and (then) sleep the next day.
 
x Well Then, said the raven, as she flew,               If I were a young one, I'd have two;
   One for to fetch and the other for to sow,        & I'd have a (little) string for my bow bow bow.
