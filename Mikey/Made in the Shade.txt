Made in the Shade
Red Stick Ramblers

Wellllll......
Y[C]ou've heard of White Lightning, heard of Mountain Dew, 
M[F]oonshine Whiskey and corn squeezins too.
D[G]own in Opelousas, that's Louisiann'
F[G]or stuff of that sort I know[C] just the man.
H[C]e's got a little white house on the edge of town
W[F]ith empty liquor bottles just scattered around.
H[G]e'll fire it up and fill them one at a time
U[G]nder his carport where the[C] sun don't shine.

I[F]f you see me at a party on Friday night
J[C]ust pickin and a grinning and feeling alright
C[F]hances are my back pockets got a little thirst aid
I[C]t comes from Opelousas and it's[G] made in the shade......

Let me tell you more about it before you take a swig
He's got an empty beer keg on a propane rig
He's got miles of copper tubing coming out of the top
So you gotta sit a spell before you see the first drop
He says sit right down and we'll kill some time
and be brandishes a bottle of his muscadine wine
Got nothing to do til later tonight
So pass me the bottle everything is alright

If you see me at a party on Friday night
Cookin' and a lookin' like I'm feeling alright
Chances are my back pockets got a little thirst aid
It comes from Opelousas and it's made in the shade......

(Dougie's Verse)
Guys I got to tell you not to drink a lot
It'll make you crazy it will make you hot
It'll shrink your testes, it'll make you dumb
Which ain't too good if you're trying to get some
Ladies you should really take it easy too
Less you like doing the hoochie coo
It'll go to your heart, it'll go to your head
And you wake up with some ugly lookin' jerk in bed.

Repeat Chorus 2X
