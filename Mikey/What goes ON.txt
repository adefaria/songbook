(Chorus)
          [C]                                    [F]
What goes on in your heart?  what goes on in your mind?
         [C]                                        [F]
You are tearing me apart, when you treat me so unkind
          [G7]         [C]
What goes on in your mind?


     [C]                         [Fm]
The other day I saw you, as I walked along the road
     [C]                                [Fm]
But when I saw him with you, I could feel my future  fold
                    [G7]               [C]           [G
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie, tell me why

(Chorus)

I met you in the morning, waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie, tell me why

(Chorus)

I used to think of no one else, but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me, as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?  Tell me why

(Chorus)
