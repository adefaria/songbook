[Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]when will those [F]clouds all disapp[C]ear? 
[Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]where will it [F]lead us from h[C]ere? 
With no [G]loving in our souls and no [Dm]money in our [Am]coats 
[C]You can't [F]say we're satisf[G]ied 
But A[Am]ngie, [E7]Angie, [G]you can't [F]say we never t[C]ried 


[Am]Angie, you're [E7]beautiful, [G]but ain't it [F]time we said good-[C]bye? 
[Am]Angie, I still [E7]love you, [G]remember [F]all those nights we [C]cried? 
All the [G]dreams we held so close seemed to [Dm]all go up in [Am]smoke 
[C]Let me [F]whisper in your [G]ear: 
[Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]where will it [F]lead us from [C]here? 

Oh, [G]Angie, don't you weep, all your k[Dm]isses still taste [Am]sweet 
[C]I hate that [F]sadness in your [G]eyes 
But [Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]ain’t it [F]time we said good-[C]bye? 
With no [G]loving in our souls and no [Dm]money in our c[Am]oats 
[C]You can't s[F]ay we're satisf[G]ied

[Dm]Ev’rywhere I look I see your [Am]eyes 
[Dm]There ain't a woman that comes c[Am]lose to you 
[C]Come on [F]Baby, dry your [G]eyes 
But [Am]Angie, A[E7]ngie, [G]ain’t it [F]good to be a[C]live? 
[Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]they can't [F]say we never [C]tried  [Dm]   [C]
