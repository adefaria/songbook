[E]  [Em] [/] [C] [4x]
 
[Em]There’s a man who [Am]leads a life of [Em]danger
To [Em]everyone he meets he stays a s[B7]tranger
With [Em]every move he makes, a[Am]nother chance he takes
[Em]Odds are he won't l[Am]ive to see tom[Em]orrow
 
Secret [Bm]agent [Em]man, secret agent [Em]man                      
The[C]y’ve given you a [B7]number and taken [C]away your [Em]name
 
Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind  
Ah, be careful what you say, Or you'll give yourself away   
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
(Chorus) 

Swingin' on the Riviera one day
And then layin' in the Bombay alley next day
Oh no, you let the wrong word slip, while kissing persuasive lips
 
[Em] [/] [C]  [E] [3x]
