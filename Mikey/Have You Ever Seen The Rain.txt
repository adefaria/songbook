Have You Ever Seen The Rain - Credence

[C] Someone told me long ago 
[C] There's a calm before the storm,
I [G] know; It's been comin' [C] for some time.
[C] When it's over, so they say, 
[C] It'll rain a sunny day,
I [G] know; Shinin' down like [C] water.

[CHORUS:]
[F] I want to [G] know, 
Have you [C] ever seen the [Am] rain?
[F] I want to [G] know, 
Have you [C] ever seen the [Am] rain?
[F] Comin' [G] down on a sunny [C] day?

[C] Yesterday, and days before, 
[C] Sun is cold and rain is hard,
[G] I know; Been that way for [C] all my time.
[C] And forever, on it goes 
[C] Through the circle, fast and slow,
[G] I know; It can't stop, I [C] wonder.
