 {title:Memphis}

Long[B7] distance information, give me Memphis Tennessee
Help me find a party that tried to get in touch with me
Sh[E]e could not leave a number but I know who placed the call
â€˜Cause[B7] my uncle took a messag[E]e and he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high upon a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge

Dm (shaped chord B6) on 7th fret, Dm (shaped chord A6) on 5th fret 4x
Dm (shaped chord) on 12th fret, Dm (shaped chord) on 10th fret 2x
Dm (shaped chord B6) on 7th fret, Dm (shaped chord A6) on 5th fret 1 1/2x


Last time I saw Marie she was wavin' me goodbye
With "hurry-home" drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
Marie is only six years old, information please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee
