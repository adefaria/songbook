Verse 
  A 
Went up to the mountain,  
                        E7 
Just to give my horn a blow 
   A                 D 
Thought I heard my true love say 
   A      E7       A 
"Yonder comes my beau" 

Took my gal to a blacksmith shop 
To have her mouth made small 
She turned around a time or two 
And swallowed shop and all 

Possum in a `simmon tree 
Racoon on the ground 
Racoon says"You son of a gun" 
Shake some `simmons down
