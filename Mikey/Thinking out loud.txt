[D]When your[D/F#] legs don't work like they used[G] to befor[A]e   
[D]And I can[D/F#]’t sweep you off of your fee[G]t[A]    
[D]Will you[D/F#]r mouth still remember the tas[G]te of my lov[A]e   
[D]Will y[D/F#]our eyes still smile from your c[G]heeks [A]   
[D]And dar[D/F#]ling I will be [G]loving you[A] till we're 70    
[D]And ba[D/F#]by my heart could still fall as hard at 23     
And I’m[G] thinking about[A] how    
   
[Em]People fall in love in myst[A]erious [D]ways   
[Em]Maybe just a touch of a h[A]and   
(Maybe it is a part of a plan)     
Well[Em] me I fall in love with you e[A]very single [Bm]day    
(I'm just keeping making the same mistakes)   
And [Em]I just wanna tell you I [A]am   
(Hoping that you'll understand)     

      [D][D/F#][G][A]              
So honey now   
(That baby now)   
      [D][D/F#][G][A]   
Take me into your loving arms    
      [D][D/F#][G][A]                                
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars    

       [D][D/F#][G][A]                                   
Place your head on my beating heart    
I'm thinking out loud   

    
And maybe [Bm]we f[A]ound l[G]ove r[D/F#]ight wh[Em]ere [A]we [D]are   

   

And when my hair's overgrown and my memory fades   

And the crowds don't remember my name   

When my hands don't play the strings the same way   

I know you will still love me the same   

   

Cause honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen     

And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory   

And I'm thinking about how
