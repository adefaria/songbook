I call your n[E7]ame but you're not the[C#7]re
Was I to b[F#7]lame for being unfa[B7]ir
Oh I can't sl[E7]eep at night since you've been gon[C#7]e
I never w[F#7]eep at night, [A]I can't go on

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know I can't ta[A]ke it
I don't know who [C#m]can     
I'm not going to m[F#]ake it
I'm not that kind of [C]m[B7]an.

[Chorus]
Oh I can't sle[E7]ep at night but just the sa[C#7]me
I never w[F#7]eep at night I call your[A] name.
