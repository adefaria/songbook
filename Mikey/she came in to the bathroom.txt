{title:She Came In Through the Bathroom Window}

[A]                                [D]
She came in through the bathroom window
[A]                     [D]
Protected by a silver spoon
[A]                               [D]
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
                          ]A]
By the banks of her own lagoon

(Chorus) 
[A]              [Dm]
Didn't anybody tell her?
[A]              [Dm]
Didn't anybody see?
[G7]                       [C]
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
]G7]                        [C]  [A]
Tuesday's on the phone to me
 

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked in fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew but I could not say
 

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob
 
(Chorus)
