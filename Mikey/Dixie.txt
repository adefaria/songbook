Dixie

      G
Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton,
C
Old times there are not forgotten,
      G          Em         D         G
Look away, look away, look away Dixie Land.
   G
In Dixie Land, where I was born in,
C
early on one frosty mornin', 
      G          Em         D         G
Look away, look away, look away Dixie Land. 

  G             C         A7      D
I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray! Hooray! 
   G               C
In Dixie Land I ll take my stand
   G               D
to live and die in Dixie. 
 G     D     G                 D  G
Away, away, away down south in Dixie. 
 G     D     G                 D  G
Away, away, away down south in Dixie 


Ole Missus marry "Will the weaver"
Willum was a gay deceiver
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Dixie Land

But when he put his arm around 'er,
He smiled fierce as a forty pounder,
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Dixie Land

His face was sharp as a butcher's cleaver
But that did not seem to grieve 'er
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Dixie Land

Ole Missus acted the foolish part
And died for a man that broke her heart
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Dixie Land

Now here's a health to the next ole Missus
An' all the gals that want to kiss us;
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Dixie Land

But if you want to drive 'way sorrow
Come and hear this song tomorrow
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Dixie Land

There's buckwheat cakes and Injun batter,
Makes you fat or a little fatter;
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Dixie Land

Then hoe it down and scratch your gravel,
To Dixie's Land I'm bound to travel,
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Dixie Land

[D] It's [A] amazing how [G] you can speak [A] right to my [D] heart [A-G-A]
[D] Without [A] saying a [G] word you can [A] light up the [D] dark [A-G-A]
[G] Try as I may I could [A] never explain
[D] What I [A] hear when you [G] don't say a [A] thing

[D] The smile on your [A] face lets me [G] know that you [A] need me
There's a [D] truth in your [A] eyes sayin' [G] you'll never [A] leave me
The [D] touch of your [A] hand says you'll [G] catch me if ever I [A] fall [G-A]
[G] You say it best [A] when you say nothing at [D] all [A-G-A]

Instrumental (Verse)

[D] All day [A] long I can [G] hear people [A] talking out [D] loud [A-G-A]
[D] But when [A] you hold me [G] near, you [A] drown out the [D] crowd [A-G-A]
[G] Old Mr. Webster could [A] never define
[D] What's being [A] said between [G] your heart and [A] mine

[D] The smile on your [A] face lets me [G] know that you [A] need me
There's a [D] truth in your [A] eyes sayin' [G] you'll never [A] leave me
The [D] touch of your [A] hand says you'll [G] catch me if ever I [A] fall [G-A]
[G] You say it best [A] when you say nothing at [D] all [A-G-A]
