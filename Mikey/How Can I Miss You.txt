Dan Hicks

I'[G]ve talked to your m[G]other and I've talked to your d[C]ad,
They [G]say they've tried but it's all in [C]vain.
I've [G]begged and I've pleaded, I [C]even got m[A]ad,
[D7]Now we must face it, you [G]give me a pain.

CHORUS
[F]How can I miss you when you w[C]on't go away?
[F]I keep telling you [C]day after day,
[F]But you won't listen, you a[C]lways stay and[A]stay,        
[D]How can I miss you when you [G]won't go a-[C]way?

Your never-ending presence really cramps my style,
I dream that it won't always be the same.
At first I was attracted, but after a while,
Have you ever heard of a "hard to get me?" 

CHORUS            Out of three billion people, why must it be me?
Oh, why, oh, why won't you cut me loose?
Just do me a favor and listen to my plea
I'm not the only chicken on the roost
CHORUS
