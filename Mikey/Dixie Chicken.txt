  DIXIE CHICKEN by Little Feat

              A                                             E
I've seen the bright lights of Memphis, and the Commodore Hotel
                                                A
and underneath the streetlamp, I met a southern belle


C    C#  D              A                         E
Well she took me to the river, where she cast her spell
                                                   A
and in that southern moonlight, she sang a song so well

CHORUS
E         A                                          E
If you'll be my dixie chicken, I'll be your Tenessee lamb
                                 A  E  A            A  E  A
and we can walk together down in Dixieland, down in Dixieland


Well we made all the hotspots, my money flowed like wine
and then that low-down southern whiskey, began to fog my mind

and I don't remember church bells, or the money I put down
on the white picket fence and boardwalk, of the house at the edge of town

oh but boy do I remember, the strain of her refrain
and the nights we spent together, and the way she'd call my name


CHORUS


Well it's been a year since you ran away,
yes that guitar player should could play
she always liked to sing along,
she's always handy with a song

and then one night in the lobby, yeah, of the Commodore Hotel
I chanced to meet a bartender, who said he knew her well

and as he handed me a drink, he began to hum a song
and all the boys there at the bar, began to sing along


CHORUS
