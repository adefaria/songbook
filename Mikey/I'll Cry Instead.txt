{title:I’ll Cry instead}

[G]I've got every reason on earth to be mad,
Cos I just lost the only girl I had[D]
If [C]I could get my way, I'd get myself locked up today
But I [G]can't, so I'll c[D]ry ins[G]tead

[G]I got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet[D]
If [C]I could see you now, I'd try to make you say it somehow
But I [G]can't, so I'll cry[D] instead[G]

[Bridge]
Don't wanna cr[Bm]y when there's people there
I get [A]shy when they start to stare
I'm go[D]nna hide myself away, but I'[E7]ll come back aga[A7]in some d[D7]ay

And w[G]hen I do you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world[D]
Yes I[C]'m gonna break 'em in two
and show you what your loving man can do
U[G]ntil then I'[D]ll cry[G] instead

[Bridge]
Don't wanna cr[Bm]y when there's people there
I get [A]shy when they start to stare
I'm go[D]nna hide myself away, but I[E7]'ll come back aga[A7]in some d[D7]ay
