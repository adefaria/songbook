Help me forget
Douglas W. Fielder
[E] [F#] [B]
When I was a [E] young man, I had a [B] life planned
It kept on [E] changing,  life’s re-ar[B]ranging
I had some [F#] good times, [walk down to E] don’t get me [B] wrong
[A] but I always [E] wondered when you’d come [B] along

There’s been some [E] lovers, then there were [B] others
but it’s been a [E] good life and I had a [B] good wife
[B] Looking back [F#] now, [E] it’s all just a [B] blur
[A] Time to [E] erase all those memories of [B] her

When I look in your [E] eyes
Well I just want to [F#] cry
Help me [E] forget, don’t ask me [F#] why
There’s too many [E} memories, that fill me with [B] sorrow
When I should be [A] happy you’ll be in my [E] arms when I wake up [B] tomorrow
I want to forget [E] them, now that I am with [B] you
I don’t want those [E] memories to make me feel [B] blue
Your smiling [F#] face [E] just brightens my [B] day
[A] This is the [E] way that want it to [B] stay

When I look in your [E] eyes
Well I just want to [F#] cry
Help me [E] forget, don’t ask me [F#] why
There’s too many [E} memories, that fill me with [B] sorrow
When I should be [A] happy you’ll be in my [E] arms when I wake up [B] tomorrow

When I look in your [E] eyes
I should just want to [F#] smile
Knowing that [E] you are here and[F#] I’ll 
Leave those memories be [E] hind us, they no longer [B] exist
I should have [A] let them all go when I [E] held you the first time we [B] kissed
I should have [A] let them all go when I [E] held you the first time we [B] kissed
