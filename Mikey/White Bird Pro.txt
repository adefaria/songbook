It s A Beautiful Day  Capo III

[A] [G] 4x

[A]White bird, in a g[G]olden cage
On a w[A]inter's day, in the [G]rain]
[A]white bird, just [G]sits in her cage[A], alone
The [A]leaves blow, cross the l[G]ong black road
To the [A]darkened sky, in its r[G]age
But the [A]white bird, just [G]sits in her cage, a[A]lone

[D]White bird must[F] fly or she will [A]die


[A]White bird, dreams of the a[G]spen trees
With their [A]dying leaves, turning g[G]old
But the [A]white bird, just s[G]its in her cage,
Growing o[A]ld

[D]White bird must [F]fly or she will [A]die
[D]White bird must [F]fly or she will [A]die [G]

The [A]sunsets come, the [Em]sunsets go
The [F]clouds pile high, the [E]air moves slow
And the [A]young bird's eyes do [F]always know  [A]
She must [A]fly[G] she must [A]fly[G] she must [A]fly[G]
