[F]If I had a b[C]oat I'd [F]go out on the [C]ocean

Verse

[C]If I were [F]Roy Rogers [C]Iâ€™d sure enough be [F]single

Chorus

The mystery masked man was smart 
He got himself a Tonto 
'Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free 
But Tonto he was smarter And one day said kemo sabe Kiss my ass 
I bought a boat I'm going out to sea

Chorus

And if I were like lightning I wouldn't need no sneakers 
I'd come and go wherever I would please 
And I'd scare 'em by the shade tree And I'd scare 'em by the light pole 
But I would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea

Chorus
