Hurt  - Trent Reznor

[Am]I [C] hurt my[D]self [Am]today
To [C]see if [D]I still [Am] feel
I [C] focus [D]on the[Am] pain
The [C] only [D] thing that's [Am] real
The[C] needle[D] tears a [Am] hole
The[C] old[D] familiar [Am] sting
Try to[C] kill it[D] all [Am] away
But [C] I remember [D] everything[G] 

Choris
[Am]What have I[Am] become?
[C]My sweetest[G] friend
[Am]Everyone I [Am] know
Goes [C]away in the[G] end
[Am]You could have it [F] all
[C]My empire of[G]dirt
[Am]I will let you [F]down
[G]I will make you [Am]hurt


I wear my crown of shit
On my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stain of time
The feeling disappears
You are someone else
I am still right here

CHORIS

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
