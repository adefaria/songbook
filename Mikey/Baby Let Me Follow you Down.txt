Can I come home with you, baby can I come home with you?
Yes I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
If you just let me come home with you.

I'll buy you a broken twine, honey, just for you to climb
I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
if you just once drive me out of my mind

I'll buy you a serpent skirt,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt
I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
if you just don't make me hurt.









Live 1966 Version
Differences from the above:
Capo 2nd fret (Dylan's guitar anyway. Robbie may be playing without a capo)
The F has much more of a Dm about it (sounds better as an Em or a G6 (320000) without a capo – but it's probably Garth on the organ)
The Eb/g is played as a straight Eb (F without capo)
The subtleties of the bass line . . . well, what's a bass player there for anyway?
G                      F     C                      Eb
Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
          G     D             C           D
Well I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
       C           D          G
If you just let me follow you down.

I'll buy you a diamond ring, I'll buy you a wedding gown
Well I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
If you just let me follow you down.

Can I come home with you, baby can I come home with you?
Yes I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
If you just let me come home with you.

I'll buy you a broken twine, honey, just for you to climb
I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
if you just once drive me out of my mind

I'll buy you a serpent skirt,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt
I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
if you just don't make me hurt.

Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
Well I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
If you just let me follow you down.
