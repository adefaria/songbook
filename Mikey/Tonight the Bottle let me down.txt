Tonight the Bottle let me down.
Merle Haggard
A - E - A - E - A (Country Rock Beat)
Tonight the bottle let me down
It let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down

Each night I leave the bar room when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight your memory found me much too sober
I can't drink enough to keep you off my mind

Tonight the bottle let me down
It let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down

--- Instrumental ---

I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turnin' every day
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to
Well, I'm hurtin' in old familiar ways

Tonight the bottle let me down
It let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down
