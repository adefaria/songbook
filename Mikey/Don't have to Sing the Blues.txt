Don’t Have To Sing The Blues
Douglas W. Fielder
[A7] Since I met my [F#7] baby, it’s [B7] been [E7] nothing [E7] but good [A7] news…
[A7] Since I met my [F#7] baby, [B7] I don’t [E7] have to sing the [A7] blues
[D9] You know she makes me feel alright [A7]…
[D9] You know she comes around [[F#7]] every night…
[B7] And in the morning there’s a [E7] smile upon my….
[C9]Smile up [B9] on my [A7] face…..

You know my baby, found a way to make me high
You know my baby, got me looking at the sky
I used to look down at my shoes
I guess that’s why I always sang the blues
But now I happy when I’m looking at her…
Looking at her face……
[D9] It’s a simple reci [A7] pe…
[D9] A little sugar, can’t you [A7]see…
[D9] When you cook it up it’ll [A7] be just [F#7] right…
[B7] We’ll be smiling til the [E7] morning light…..
Since I met my baby, there’s something new for me to play
Since I met my baby, I feel the sunshine every day
Just like eating eggs with steak
Got a spring in every step I take
There ain’t nothing gonna make me change
The way I feel today…..
