{title:Something Tells Me I’m Into Something Good}

[C]           [F]            [C]           [F]
Woke up this morning feeling fine
[C]           [F]            [C]           [F]        [C]
[There’s something special on my mind
[F]                                               [C]
Last night I met a new girl in the neighborhood, whoa yeah
[G]                           [F]                      [C]
Something tells me I'm into something good
[F]                    [C]              [F]
(Something tells me I’m into something)

She's the kind of girl who's not too shy
And I can tell I'm her kind of guy
She danced close to me like I hoped she would
(she danced with me like I hoped she would)
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something)

(Bridge)
[G]
We only danced for a minute or two
        [C]         [F]                             [C]
But then she stuck close to me the whole night through
[G]
Can I be falling in love?
[D]                  [D7]                                       [G]
She’s everything I’ve been dreaming of
                          [D7]                    [G]
(She’s everything I’ve been dreaming of)

I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could
(I asked to see her and she told me I could)
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something)
(Something tells me I'm into something, ahhh)
(BREAK -Repeat)
