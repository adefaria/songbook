Ford Econoline

Nancy Griffith

She drove [D] west from Salt Lake City to the [D] California coastline
She hit the [D] San Diego Freeway doing [D} sixty miles an [A] hour
She had a [D] husband on her bumper
She had [D] five restless children
She was [D] singing sweet as a mockingbird in that [A] Ford Econo [D] line

[Chorus:]
She's the [G] salt of the [D] earth
[A} Straight from the bosom of the [D] Mormon church
With a [G] voice like [D] wine
[A] Cruising along in that [G] Ford Econoline

Now her [D] husband was a gambler, he was a Salt Lake City rambler
He built a golden cage all around his silver-throated [A] wife
Too many [D] nights he left her crying with his cheating and his lying
But his big mistake was him buying her that [A] Ford Econoline

[Chorus]

She sings her [D]songs around this country
From Seattle to Montgomery
Those kids are grown and that rounder knows
That you cannot cage your [A] wife
Along the [D] back roads of our nation, she's become a living legend
She drives a Coupe DeVille but her heart rides still
In that [A] Ford Econoline

[Chorus]

She sings her [D]songs around this country
From Seattle to Montgomery
Those kids are grown and that rounder knows
That you cannot cage your [A] wife
Along the [D] back roads of our nation, she's become a living legend
She drives a Coupe DeVille but her heart rides still
In that [A] Ford Econoline
