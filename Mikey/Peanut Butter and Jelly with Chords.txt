Peanut Butter & Jelly – Douglas W. Fielder
[E] When I was a boy my momma said son
Life is simple, just try and have fun
[A] Find all the things that appeal to you
[E] That’s the way to make your dreams come true
[B] It’s not complicated, don’t make it that way
Just [A] do what you like and you’ll be okay

(Chorus)
I like [E] Peanut Butter and Jelly. I like Peanut Butter and Jelly
[A] Walks on the beach and a fiery sunset
[E] A funny movie and the internet
[B] Strumming my six string or picking the bass
[A] Looking at the smile on your beautiful face
I like [E] Peanut Butter and Jelly, I like Peanut Butter and Jelly

[E] Now I spent a long time trying to keep
up with the Jonses, I got in deep
[A] Til I remembered what my momma said
[E] Now I’m enjoying my life instead
It [B] doesn’t cost much to spend a day in the sun
[A] Life’s much better when you’re having fun

(Chorus)
If you’re [E] bound and determined to have it all
Be my guest, friend, have a ball
[A] But don’t forget what my momma said
[E] Cause sooner or later we’ll all be dead
You can [B] choose to be happy and enjoy the day
[A] Join me on the beach with my PBJ

I like Peanut Butter and Jelly, I like Peanut Butter and Jelly
A cold glass of milk with some Oreos
Walking in the surf and wiggling my toes
Spooning all night at my babies place
I finally figured out that it ain’t a race
I like Peanut Butter and Jelly, I like Peanut Butter and Jelly
