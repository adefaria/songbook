Time
The Greencards


Capo 2

       G                D
On the wind, I feel the warmth
         Em               C
Like the town where I was born
        G               D
Blowin' down a two lane road
              Em              C  
It rides just like the one back home
           G        D             C     
I close my eyes and then go back again


I hear a song on the radio
Reminds me of someone I use to know
We'd stay up until the dawn
Now that someone is gone
I close my eyes and then go back again

Bridge:
C         G              Em    C     D
Time is a river, rollin' o-o-o-ut to sea
           G        D             C    G
I close my eyes and then go back again


Mandolin solo


Last night, I had a dream
About a place I'd never been
Shinin' sun on fields of gold
It could be heaven for all I know
I close my eyes and then go back again


Bridge

I close my eyes and then go back again and again
