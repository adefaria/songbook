C                                       (C7)  
I'm a-goin' down this road feelin' bad
     F                            C 
I'm goin' down this road feelin' bad			
     F                            C                
I'm goin' down this road feelin' bad, bad, bad 
       G7                            C 
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way  

I'm goin' where the water taste like wine 
I'm goin' where the water taste like wine 
I'm goin' where the water taste like wine, wine, wine 
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way  

Chorus

Takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my feet 
Takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my feet 
Takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my feet, lord, lord 
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way  

Chorus

Your two dollar shoe hurts my feet 
I said, your two dollar shoe hurts my feet 
Your two dollar shoe hurts my feet, Lord, God 
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way 

Chorus

I ain't gonna be treated this a-way 
I ain't gonna be treated this a-way 
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way, Lord, God 
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way
