                      OLD JOE CLARK
                       ----------------

  A
Old Joe Clark is mad at me

                         G
I'll tell you the reason why

 A
I ran through his cabbage patch

             G      A 
And tore up all his rye

Chorus:
~~~~~~~ 
         A        
        Old Joe Clark
        
        Joe Joe Clark
                        G        
        Goodbye Billie Brown

         A        
        Old Joe Clark
        
        Joe Joe Clark
                   G        A 
        I'm gonna leave this town


I went down to Old Joe Clark's
To get me a glass of wine
He tied me up to his wooden post
And gave me forty-nine

Chorus:
~~~~~~

Well I went down to Old Joe Clark's
To get me a glass of gin 
He pulled me apart, whippin' his horse
And gave me hell again

Chorus:
~~~~~~

I don't give a damn for Old Joe Clark
I'll tell you the reason why
He blows his nose in old corn bread
And calls it chicken pie

Chorus:
~~~~~~

Old Joe Clark and my horse
Are blow-down filthy popular 
Run, then bolt, gun it to the fence
And drunk my liquor up

Chorus:
~~~~~~

Well Old Joe Clark is dead and gone
I hope he's gone to hell
He made me wear the ball and chain
Made my ankles swell

Chorus:
