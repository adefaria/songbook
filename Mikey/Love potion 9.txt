[Am]I took my troubles down to M[Dm]adame Ruth.

[C]She’s got a pad down on T[Am]hirty-Fourth and Vine,
[Dm]sellin’ little bottles of, [E]Love Potion Number[Am]Nine.

[Am]I told her that I was a f[Dm]lop with chicks.
[Am]I’ve been this way since nineteen-[Dm]fifty-six.
She [C]looked at my palm and she [Am]made a magic sign..
She [Dm]said, 'What you need is[E]Love Potion Number[Am]Nine

CHORUS:
She [Dm]bent down and turned around and gave me a wink.
She [B]said "I'm gonna mix it up right here in the sink."
It s[Dm]melled like turpentine, it looked like India Ink..
I [E]held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink.


[Am]I didn't know if it was d[Dm]ay or night.
[Am]I started kissin' everyt[Dm]hing in sight.
But [C]when I kissed a cop down on [Am]Thirty-Fourth and Vine..
He [Am]broke my little bottle of [E]Love Potion Number[Am]Nine
