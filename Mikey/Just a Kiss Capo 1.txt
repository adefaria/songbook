Just a Kiss – Lady Antbellum
CAPO 1
[C] [Am]
[Am] Lyin' here with you so close to [F] me
It's hard to fight these [Am] feelings when it feels so hard to [F] breathe
Caught up in this [Dm] moment
Caught up in your [G] smile

[Am] I've never opened up to any [F] one
So hard to hold back 
[Am] when I'm holding you in my [F] arms
We don't need to [Dm] rush this
Let's just take this [G] slow

[CHORUS]
[Am] Just a kiss on your [F] lips in the moonlight
[C] Just a touch in the [G] fire burning so bright
[Am] And I don't want to [F] mess this thing [G] up
I don't want to [Em] push too far
[Am] Just a shot in the [F] dark that you just might
[C] Be the one I've been [G] waiting for my [Dm] whole life
So baby I'm al [F] right, with just a [G] kiss goodnight   [Am walk down to F]

[Am] I know that if we give this a [F] little time
It will only bring us 
[Am] closer to the love we wanna [F] find
It's never felt so [Dm] real, no it's never felt so [G] right

[CHORUS]

[Dm] No I [Am] don't want to say good [Dm] night
I [Am] know it's time to [Em] leave, 
but [F] you'll be in my [G] dreams
[Am][Am G bass] [F] Tonight 
[Am][Am G bass] [F] Tonight
[Am][Am G bass] [F] [Duet] Tonight

[Am] Just a kiss on your [F] lips in the moonlight
[C] Just a touch in the [G] fire burning so bright
[Am] And I don't want to [F] mess this thing [G] up
I don't want to [Em] push too far
[Am] Just a shot in the [F] dark that you just might
[C] Be the one I've been [G] waiting for my [Dm] whole life
so [F] baby I'm [Dm] alright, oh oh [Em]  oh, let's do this [F] right [G]
with just a kiss goodnight [Am][Am G bass] [F]
With a kiss goodnight [Am][Am G bass] [F]
Kiss goodnight
