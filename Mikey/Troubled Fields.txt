
Troubled Fields

Nancy Griffith

[G] Baby I [C] know that we've got [Bm] trouble in the [C] fields
When the [G] bankers swarm like [C] locust out there [D] turning away our [G] yields
The [G] trains roll [C] by our silos, [Bm] silver in the [C] rain
They [G] leave our pockets full of [C] nothing
But our [D] dreams and the golden [G] grain

Have you [G] seen the [C] folks in line [Bm] downtown at the [C] station
[G] They're all  buying their [C] ticket out and [D] talking the great [G] depression
Our parents [C] had their hard times [Bm] fifty years [C] ago
When they [G] stood out in these [C] empty fields in [D] dust as deep as [G] snow

[Chorus:]
And all this [C] trouble in our [D] fields
If this [G] rain can fall, these [C] wounds can heal
[C] They'll never [D] take our native [G] soil
But if we [C] sell that new John [D] Deere
And then we'll [G] work these crops with [C] sweat and tears
You'll be the [G] mule I'll be the [Am] plow
Come harvest [Bm] time we'll work it [C] out
There's still a [Am] lotta love, [D] here in these troubled [G] fields

There's a [G] book up [C] on the shelf [Bm] about the dust bowl [C] days
And there's a [G] little bit of you and a [C] little bit of me
In the [D] photos on every [G] page
Now our children [C] live in the city and they [Bm] rest upon our [C] shoulders
[G] They never want the [C] rain to fall or the [D] weather to get [G] colder

[Chorus]

You'll be the [G] mule I'll be the [Am] plow
Come harvest [Bm] time we'll work it [C] out
There's still a [Am] lotta love, [D] here in these troubled [G] fields
