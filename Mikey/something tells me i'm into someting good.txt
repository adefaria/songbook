{title:Something Tells Me I’m Into Something Good}

[C]Woke up[F] this m[C]orning[F] feeling fine
[C]There’s som[F]ething s[C]pecial on my mind
[F]Last night I met a new girl in t[C]he neighborhood, whoa yeah
[G]Something tel[F]ls me I'm into[C] something good
(Somet[F]hing te[C]lls me [F]I’m into something)

She's the kind of girl who's not too shy
And I can tell I'm her kind of guy
She danced close to me like I hoped she would
(she danced with me like I hoped she would)
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something)

(Bridge)
[G]We only danced for a minute or two
But then[C] she stuck [F]close[C] to me the whole night through
[G]Can I be falling in love?
[D]She’s everything I’[D7]ve been [G]dreaming of
She's everything [D7]I’ve bee[G]n dreaming of


I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could
(I asked to see her and she told me I could)
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something)
(Something tells me I'm into something, ahhh)
