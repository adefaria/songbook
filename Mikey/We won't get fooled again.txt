Won't Get Fooled Again

A                        D                 A               D    
We'll be fighting in the streets, with our children at our feet,
        A                D               E     C G       
and the morals that they worship will be gone.
        A                  D         A                D
And the men who spurred us on sit in judgement of all wrong,
        A           D                 E      C G
they decide and the shotgun sings the song.



     D      A          D         A
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
D      A           D       A
take a bow for the new revolution,
D         A           D          A
smile and grin at the change all around,
G                     E7
pick up my guitar and play
G               E7
just like yesterday,
         G                   D        D7
and I'll get on my knees and pray.
                     A     G D
We don't get fooled again.

The change  it  had  to  come,  we  knew  it  all  along,
        A           D                     E     C G       
we were liberated   from the fold, that's all.
        A                     D         A                D
And the world  looks just the same, and history ain't changed,
        A                      D                E      C G
'cause the banners   were all flown in the last war.

I'll move myself and my family aside,
E  
if we happen to be left half alive,
     A
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky,
         B7                             B     A  E
though I know that the hypnotized never lie.

YEAH.....
        A              D
There's nothing in the streets
          A            D
Looks any different to me
        A             D              E   C  G
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
        A              D
And the parting on the left
        A              D
Are now parting on the right
        A                     D             E  C  G
And the beards have all grown longer overnight
