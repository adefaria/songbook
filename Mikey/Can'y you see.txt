[D]GONNA TAKE A FREIGHT TRAIN,  [C]DOWN AT THE STATION LO[C]RD.

[D]GONNA CLIMB A MOUNTAIN,  T[C]HE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN 
J[G]UMP OFF, AIN”T[D] NOBODY GONNA KNOW.   
 
CHORUS  
CAN'T YOU SEE,     CAN'T YOU SEE,  
WHAT  THAT WOMAN, SHE BEEN DOIN' TO ME.    
CAN'T YOU SEE,     CAN'T YOU SEE,  
WHAT  THATWOMAN, SHE BEEN DOIN' TO ME.  
 
I'M GONNA FIND ME,  A HOLE IN THE WALL,     
GONNA CRAWL INSIDE AND DIE 
THAT LADY,    MEAN OL' WOMAN LORD,   
NEVER TOLD ME  GOODBYE.   
 
CHORUS & SOLO

AIN'T NEVER COMIN' BACK 
RIDE ME A SOUTHBOUND,  ALL THE WAY TO GEORGIA NOW  
TILL THE TRAIN IT RUN OUT OF TRACK
