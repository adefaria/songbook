{title:Hoochie Coochie Man}                              

[E] [G] [G] [G] [A]  
The gypsy woman told my mother,
before I was born 
I got a boy child's comin',
he's gonna be a son of a gun 
He gonna make pretty women's,
jump and shout
Then the world wanna know,                  
[A]what this all ab[A7]out

[Chorus]

But you know I'm [A]him,
[A7]everybody knows I'm [A]him
Well you know I'm the [E]hoochie coochie man[D],
[E]every[E7]body knows I'm [A]him

I got a black cat bone,
I got a mojo too
I got the Johnny Concheroo,
I'm gonna mess with you
I'm gonna make you girls,
lead me by my hand
Then the world will know,
the [A]hoochie coochie [A7]man

[Chorus]

On the seventh hours,
on the seventh day
On the seventh month,
the seven doctors say
He was born for good luck,
and that you'll see
I got seven hundred dollars,
[A]donâ€™t you mess with [A7]me


[Chorus]
