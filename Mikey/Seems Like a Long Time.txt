Seems Like a Long Time
Brewer & Shipley
[G] Nighttime is only [D] the other side of daytime
but [C] if you've ever waited for the [G] sun [D]
[Em] you know what it's like to [D] wish daytime would [C] come
And don't it [G] seem like a long time
[D] seem like a long time, [C] seem like a [D] long, long [G] time

Hard times are only the other side of good times
but if you ever wished hard times were gone
you know what it's like to wish good times would come
And don't it seem like a long time
seem like a long time, seem like a long, long time

Help me, seems like a long time
seems like a long time, seems like a long, long time

And don't it seem like a long time
seem like a long time, seem like a long, long time
And don't it seem like a long time
seem like a long time, seem like a long, long time
And don't it seems like a long time
seems like a long time, seems like a long, long time

You know it makes me sad
seems like a long time, seems like a long time
seems like a long, long time

War time is only the other side of peace time
but if you've ever seen how wars are won
you know what it's like to wish peace time would come
And don't it seem like a long time
seem like a long time, seems like a long, long time
