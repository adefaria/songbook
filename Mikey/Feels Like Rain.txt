FEELS LIKE RAIN

Cmaj7   G

Cmaj7                   G
    Down here the river meets the sea

Cmaj7                                 G
    And in the sticky heat I feel you open up to me
B7
    Love comes out of nowhere baby

Em       D         Cmaj7
    Just like a hurricane
                      G     Cmaj7
    And it feels like rain
                      G
    And it feels like rain

Lying underneath the stars right next to you
Wondering who you are and how do you do (how do you do baby?)
The clouds are rolling across the moon 
-
 the wind howls out your name
And it feels like rain (x2)
Baby can you feel it?
<Solo>

We ain't ever gonna make that bridge tonight, babe
Across Lake Pontchartrain
And it feels like rain (x2)
So batton down the hatches baby, leave your heart out on your sleeve
It looks like we're in for stormy weather
-
And that ain't no cause for us to leave
Just lie here in my arms and let it wash away the pain
And it feels like rain (x2)

Baby can you feel it?....

Gonna let your love wash over me.
