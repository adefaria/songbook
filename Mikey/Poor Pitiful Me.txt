Poor Poor Pitiful Me – Warren Zevon      Ver 1
Riff: F# C# G# C# / F# C# G# C#

Well I lay my head on the railroad tracks
Waiting on the double E
But the train don't run by here no more
Poor, poor pitiful me

Chorus 
F#     C#    G#       C#
Poor, poor, pitiful me
F#     C#    G#       C#
Poor, poor, pitiful me
F#          C#           G#      C#
Oh these boys won't let me be
F#                G#
Lord have mercy on me 
G#
Woe is me

(4 bar solo)

Well I met a man out in Hollywood
Now I ain't namin' names
Well he really worked me over good
Just like Jesse James 
Yes he really worked me over good
He was a credit to his gender
Put me through some changes, lord
Sort of like a Waring blender

Chorus 
F#     C#    G#       C#
Poor, poor, pitiful me
F#     C#    G#       C#
Poor, poor, pitiful me
F#          C#           G#      C#
Oh these boys won't let me be
F#                G#
Lord have mercy on me 
G#
Woe is me

							Original Lyrics

Well I met a boy in Vieux Carres			I met a girl at the Rainbow Bar
Down in Yokohama					She asked me if I'd beat her
He picked me up and threw me down			She took me back to the Hyatt House
He said “please don’t hurt me mama”			I don't want to talk about it

Poor, poor, pitiful me
F#          C#           G#      C#
Oh these boys won't let me be
F#                G#
Lord have mercy on me 
G#
Woe is me

Poor, poor, poor me, poor poor pitiful me (repeat solo out)
