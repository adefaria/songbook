(Chorus)
[E]      [Am] [C]
Michelle, ma belle.
[D]                    [C]           [B7]
These are words that go together well,
[C]    [B7]
My Michelle.

[E]         [Am] [C]
Michelle, ma belle.
[D]                 [C]                [B7]
Sont des mots qui vont trs bien ensemble,
[C]          [B7]
Trs bien ensemble.

[Em]                        [Em]
I love you, I love you, I love you.
[Dm]           [G7]      [C]
That's all I want to say.
[B7]      [Em]     [Am]
Until I find a way
       [Em]      [D]    [Em]      [E]
I will say the only words I know that
[Am]          [B7]
You'll understand. 

(Repeat Chorus)


  [Em]                    [Em]
I need to, I need to, I need to.
[Dm]        [G]        [C]
I need to make you see,
[B7]           [Em]      [Am]
Oh, what you mean to me.
  [Em]    [D]      [Em] 
Until I do I'm hoping you will
[Am]          [B7]
Know what I mean.

  [Em]                      [Em]
I want you, I want you, I want you.
[Dm]               [G7] [C]
I think you know by now
[B7]          [Em]      [Am]
I'll get to you somehow.
  [Em]    [D]      [Em]      [E]
Until I do I'm telling you so
[Am]          [B7]
You'll understand. 

(Repeat Chorus)

       [C]            [Em]   
I will say the only words I know that
[Am]     [B7]               [E]
You'll understand, my Michelle.
