{title:Never Comes the Day}

[Cadd9]Work away to[Gmaj7/B]day, [Cadd9]work away tom[B7]orrow.
[Cadd9]Never comes the [G/B]day for m[Cadd9]y [G/B]love a[Cadd9]nd [G/B]me.
I [Cadd9]feel her gently [Gmaj7/B]sighing as the [Cadd9]evening slips aw[D7]ay[Dsus7]
If [G]onl[C/G][G][D7]y you knew what's in[G]side o[C/Gf [G]me [D7]now
You [G]wouldnâ€™t [C/G][G][D7]want to know me some[G]how
But [Cm]You [G]will l[Cm]ove me [G]tonight,
[C]We al[G]one will [C/G][G]be al[C]right,
In the en[G]d.

[G][D][C][G] fast 1/2 beat between D&C
Give just a little bit more
Take a little bit less
From each other tonight
Admit what you're feeling
And see what's in front of you,
It's never out of your sight.
You know it's true,
We all know that it's true.

Work away today, think about tomorrow
Never comes the day for my love and me.
I feel her gently sighing as the evening slips away.
If only you knew what's inside of me now
You wouldn't want to know me somehow,
But
You will love me tonight,
We alone will be alright,
In the end.

[G][D][C][G]
Give just a little bit more
Take a little bit less
From each other tonight
Admit what you're feeling
And see what's in front of you,
It's never out of your sight.
You know it's true,
We all know that it's true.
