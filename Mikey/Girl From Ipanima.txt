Fmaj7      
Tall and tanned and young and lovely
    G7   
The girl from ipanema goes walking
    Gm7                   F#7                   Fmaj7  F#9
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ahhh!

Fmaj7    
When she walks, shes like a samba
     G7
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
     Gm7              F#7                        Fmaj7       
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - oohh!

F#maj7                  B9
Oh, but I watch her so sadly,
F#m7                  D9
How can I tell her I love her?
Gm7                         Eb9
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
         Am7                        Abm7
But each day, when she walks to the sea
     Gm7                         F#7
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Fmaj7
Tall, and tanned and young and lovely
    G7       
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
    Gm7                 F#7                   Fmaj7
And when she passes, I smile - but she doesnt see 
F#7              Fmaj7 F#7                 Fmaj7      F#7  Fmaj7   
She just doesn't see, no, she just doesn't see...
