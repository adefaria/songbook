[E]I'D R[F#]ATH[G]ER [A]BE IN [E]SOME DARK [A]HOLLOW
WHERE THE [A]SUN DON'T [D]EVER [A]SHINE
THEN TO [A]BE AT HOME A[A7]LONE [D]KNOWIN THAT YOUR GONE
WOULD [A]CAUSE ME TO [E]LOSE MY [A]MIND
[ Tab from: http://www.guitaretab.com/g/grateful-dead/262159.html ]
CHORUS:

[G]SO [A]BLOW YOUR [E]WHISTLE [A]FREIGHT TRAIN
TAKE ME [A]FAR ON [D]DOWN THE [A]TRACK
I'M [A]GOING AW[A7]AY, I'M [D]LEAVING TOD[D7]AY
I'M [A]GOING, BUT I [E]AIN'T COMIN' [A]BACK

VERSE 2:
I'D RATHER BE IN SOME DARK HOLLOW
WHERE THE SUN DONT EVER SHINE
THEN TO BE IN SOME BIG CITY,
IN A SMALL ROOM, WITH YOU ON MY MIND

CHORUS

VERSE 3:
I'D RATHER BE IN SOME DARK HOLLOW
WHERE THE SUN DON'T EVER SHINE
THEN TO SEE YOU ANOTHER MANS DARLIN',
AND TO KNOW THAT YOU'LL NEVER BE MINE
