Hey Hey Hey
[E]Hey, hey, hey
[A]Don't you wanna love me now, baby?
[E]Hey, hey, hey
[A]Ain't you think' 'bout me?
[Bm]I've been tr[F]yin' to get you off of my m[A]ind for some time[E] now.
Ain't goin' [A]well, bab[E]y.
Ain't much room left, babe, between these four walls.
Our hearts have grown as heavy as cannonballs.
I tried to love you, babe, and I'm tryin' still.
I've always loved you, babe, and I always will.
The neighbor's dogs are chained; they don't bark no more.
Nothin' happens here that's worth yellin' for.
But there'd be music, babe, if we ever walked by.
You know we'd wake the world, if we only tried.
And I say,
Hey, hey, hey
Don't you wanna love me now, baby?
Hey, hey, hey
Ain't you thinkin' 'bout me?
I've been tryin' to get you off of my mind for some time now.
Ain't goin' well, baby.
Won't you think about lovin' me?
Your window's open, babe, but your doors are closed.
You want a breeze to sweep in and shake your bones.
But the sky is clear as day and the air is cold.
So, come on out and play; I'm not here that long.



'Cuz, the times are tough, now, babe, but their ours to own.
Ooh ooh ooh
Make the most of it and just stay at home.
I've come by once, and I won' be back again.
Aw who'm I kiddin', babe? Won't you let me in!
And I say,
Hey, hey, hey
Don't you wanna love me now, baby?
Hey, hey, hey
Ain't you thinkin' 'bout me?
I've been tryin' to get you off of my mind for some time now.
Ain't goin' well, baby.
Won't you think about lovin' me?
