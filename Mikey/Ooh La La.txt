Poor old Granddad I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man He spoke of women's ways

They'll trap you, then they use you Before you even know
For love is blind and you're far too kind Don't ever let it show

I wish that I knew what I know now When I was younger.
I wish that I knew what I know now When I was stronger.

The Can Can's such a pretty show They'll steal your heart away
But backstage, back on earth again The dressing rooms are grey

They come on strong and it ain't too long Before they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find You're just a boy again

When you want her lips, you get a cheek Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more and she's fast asleep Then she's twinkling with the stars.

"Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can sayYou'll have to learn, just like  me And that's the hardest way Ooh la la"

I wish that I knew what I know now When I was younger.
I wish that I knew what I know now When I was stronger.
