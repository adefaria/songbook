Listen to the Radio {Capo 1}

Nancy Griffith

I am [A] leaving Mississ [D] ippi in the [E} evening rain
These [A] Delta towns wear [D] satin gowns in a [E] high beamed frame
Loretta [A] Lynn guides my [D] hands through the [E] radio
Where would I [A] be in times like [D] these without the [E] songs Loretta wrote?

Chorus
When you [D] can't find a [A] friend you've still got the [E] radio
When you [D] can't find a [A] friend you've still got the [E] radio
Radio [A] [D] listen to the [E} radio
Radio [A] [D] listen to the [E] radio

I left a [A] handsome two stepped [D] good ole boy in [E] Tennessee
Now,he's [A] sittin'n on the sofa, [D] lookin' for his supper, wonderin' [E] what's become of me
I've got a [A] double-o-eighteen [D} Martin guitar in the [E] backseat of the car
Hey, I am [A] leaving Mississ [D] ippi with the [E] radio on

Chorus

There's a [A] moon across the [D] border in the [E] Louisiana sky
I smell the [A] Pontchartrain,I hear [D] Silver Wings then, away [E] Merle Haggard 
Flies
That [A] good ole boy will find a [D] Band of Gold on the [E] stereo
Hey, then my [A] Mama's gonna call and [D] say,"Where's she gone?"
He'll [E] say ,"Down the road with the radio on."

Chorus
