Carry On

E A E A E A E A
[VERSE 1]
Well I [E]woke up to the sound of silence and [A]guns
were cutting like knives in a [E]fist fight    [A]
And [E]I found you with a bottle of wine
our [A]head in the curtains and he[E]art like the 4th of Jul[E]y

You swore and said [E]we are not
we are not [F#]shining stars
This I [G#]know
cause I never [A2]said we are
Though I've [E]never been through hell like that
I've [A]closed enough windows to know you can never look [E]back

[CHORUS]
If you're [E]lost and alone, or you're [A]sinkin like a [B]stone
Carr[E]y on    [A]          [B]
May your [E]past be the sound of your [A]feet upon the [B]ground
Carr[E]y on    [A]          [B]
Carry on carry on[E] [A]     [E]     [A]
[VERSE 2]
So I [E]met up with some friends at the edge of the [A]night
at a bar off 7[E]5    [A]
And we [E]talked and talked about how our parents will [A]die
All our nei[E]ghbors and wives    [A]
[PRE CHORUS]
But I'd [E]like to think
I can [F#]cheat it all
to make [G#]up for the times I've been [A2]cheated on
 And it's [E]nice to know
when I  was [F#]left for dead
I was [G#]found and I know not these streets
I am [A2]not the ghost you [B2]want to be

[CHORUS]
If you're [E]lost and alone, or you're s[A]inkin like a s[B]tone
Carry [E]on   [A]          [B]
May your [E]past be the sound of your [A]feet upon the [B]ground
Carry [E]on   [A]          [B]
[B]ohhhhhhhhhhhhh

[BRIDGE]
My [A]head is on [E]fire, but my [B]legs they're fine
Cause after [A]all, they are [E]mine    [B] 
Lay your clothes do[A]wn on the fl[E]oor, close the [B]door, hold the phone
show me [A]how, no one's [B]ever gonna stop us now
[E]   [F#]   [G#]  [A2]
[E]   [F#]   [G#]  [A2]

[PRE CHORUS]
Cause [E]we are, we are [F#]shining stars
We are inv[G#]incible, we are [A2]who we are
On our [E]darkest day, when we're [F#]miles away
Sun will [G#]come, we will find our way h[A2]ome   [B2]

[CHORUS]
If you're [E]lost and alone, or you're s[A]inkin like a s[B]tone
Carry o[E]n   [A]          [B]
May your [E]past be the sound of your [A]feet upon the [B]ground
Carr[E]y on   [A]          [B]


[OUTRO]
(lots of oh's here, just keep playing E then A)
Carry on c[E]arry on[A]
Carry on c[E]arry on[A]
