I ll Be Back chords
The Beatles

    Am           C        G          F
You know, if you break my heart I'll go
    E7            A       
But I'll be back again
      Am          C      G        F
Cause I, told you once before goodbye
    E7           A     
But I came back again

           F#m                 Bm                             E7
I love you so, I'm the one who wants you, yes I'm the one who wants you

D   E   D   E
Oh  ho  oh  ho

   Am              C      G         F
Oh you, could find better things to do
        E7              A
Than to break my heart again
     Am           C      G         F
This time, I will try to show that I
   E7               A
Am not trying to pretend

Bm                       C#m                F#m
I thought that you would realize, that if I ran away from you
     B7                         Bm             E7
That you would want me too, but I got a big surprise

D   E   D   E
Oh  ho  oh  ho

A             F#m
I want to go, oh 
              Bm
But I hate to leave you 
                   E7
You know I hate to leave you 
D   E   D   E
Oh, ho, Oh, ho 

Am          C        G          F
You, if you break my heart I'll go 
    E7            A
But I'll be back again
