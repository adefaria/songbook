Verse 1:
Fmaj7  C
                  Fmaj7
Tonight I'm gonna break away
G        Fmaj7    C
Just you wait and see.
                 Fmaj7
I'll never be imprisoned by
  G     Fmaj7 C
a faded memory.

Verse 2:
                      Fmaj7
Just when I think I'm over her,
     G      Fmaj7      C
this broken heart will mend.
                     Fmaj7
I hear her name and I have to cry,
    G          Fmaj7  C
the tears come down again.

Chorus:
                   Fmaj7
It happens all the time.
     G          C
This crazy love of mine,
              Fmaj7
wraps around my heart
  G        C
refusing to unwind.
Fmaj7 G   Fmaj7  C
Ooo   Ooo Crazy Love
Fmaj7  G   Fmaj7  C
Ahh    ha

Verse 3:
Count the stars in a summer sky,
that fall without a sound.
And then pretend that you can't hear
these tear drops coming down.

Verse 4:
Tonight I'm gonna break away
Just you wait and see
I'll never be imprisoned by
a faded memory.

Tonight I'm gonna break away
