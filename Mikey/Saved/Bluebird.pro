BLUEBIRD- Buffalo Springfield

TUNING: D A D G B D

[D]
[G]Listen t[G/B]o my blueb[D]ird laugh
[G]She can't t[G/B]ell you w[D]hy
[G]Deep with[G/B]in her he[D]art you see
[C]She kn[G/B]ows only cry[D]in', [C] [G/B]  just cry[D]in', [C] [G/B] y[D]eah

There she sits, a lofty perch
Strangest color blue
Flying is forgotten now
She thinks only of you, just you, awww

S[D]o get all those blues, must be a thousand hues                 
And each is differently used, you just k[C]now[G/B]
You sit there mes[D]morized by the depth of her eyes
If you could catagorize, she got s[C]oul[G/B]
She got sou[C]l,[G/B] she got sou[C]l,[G/B] she got s[D]oul

RIFF 1
[ Tab from: http://www.guitaretab.com/b/buffalo-springfield/2574.html ]
RIFF 2 (during lyrics)
Do you think she loves you
Do you think at all?

SOLO   (stop, RIFF 3, stop again, begin with banjo)

Soon she's going to fly away
Sadness is her own
Fill herself a bath of tears
And go home, and go home
