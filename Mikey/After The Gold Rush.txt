{After The Gold Rush} 

W[G]ell, I[D] dreamed I saw the knights 
In [G]armor coming, 
Sayi[D]ng someth[G]ing about a queen. 
There w[D]ere peasants singing and 
[A]Drummers drumming 
And t[G]he archer sp[A]lit the tree. 
There w[Bm]as a fanfare blowing 
[C]To the sun 
That w[G]as floa[C]ting on the breeze. 
[D]Look at Mother [A]Nature on the run 
In th[C]e nineteen [G]seventies.

[G]I was [D]lying in a burne[G]d out basement 
With t[D]he full moon[G] in my eyes.
I wa[D]s hoping [A]for replacement 
When[G] the sun burst[A] thru the sky. 
There w[Bm]as a band [C]playing in my head 
And[G] I felt like get[C]ing high. 
I wa[D]s thinking about what a 
[A]Friend had said 
I wa[C]s hoping it [G]was a lie.

[A]Friend had said 
I wa[C]s hoping it [G]was a lie. 

[G]Well, I[D]dreamed I saw the silver 
[G]Space ships flying 
In th[D]e yellow haze[G] of the sun, 
There w[D]ere children crying 
An[A]d colors flying 
All [G]around the c[A]hosen ones. 
All in a[Bm] dream, [C]all in a dream 
Th[G]e loading h[C]ad begun. 
They w[D]ere flying Mother Nature's 
[A]Silver seed t[C]o a new ho[G]me in the sun. 
[D]Flying Mother Nature's 
[A]Silver seed t[C]o a new home.
