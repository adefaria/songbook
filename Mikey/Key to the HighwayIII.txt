I'm gonna leave here running, walking is most too slow

I'm going back to the border, where I'm better known, 
,cause woman you don’t do nothing, but drive a good man ‘way from home 

Give me one more kiss, mama, just before I go, 
I'm due in West Texas, I’ve got to get on the road.  

Now, when the moon peeks over the mountain, yeah.. You know I'll be on my way 
I'm gonna walk, walk this ol' highway, deep til the break of day 

I’m going down to West Texas, down behind the farm.
I’m going to ask the good Lord, “what evil have I done?”
 
So long and good-bye, yes, I had to say good-bye, 
'Cause I'm gonna walk, walk this ol' highway, deep 'til the day I die
