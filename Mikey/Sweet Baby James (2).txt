There is a [D]cowboy he lives [A]on the [G]range[F#m]
lqHis[Bm] horse and his cattle[G] are his only comp[D]anions [F#m]
He works [Bm]in the saddle and [G]sleeps in the [D]canyons[F#m]
[G]Waiting for summer[D] his pastures[A] to [Em]change[A]
And [G]as the moon rises [A7sus]he sits by his f[D]ire,
Th[Bm]inking about wo[G]men and gl[D]asses of b[A]eer,
And cl[G]osing his eyes as the [A7sus]doggies ret[D]ire,
He s[Bm]ings out a s[G]ong which is s[D]oft but it's clear,
A[E7sus]s if maybe s[E7]omeone could[Asus] hear.  [A]

{comment:Chorus}
He says g[D]oodnight you m[G]oonlight [A7sus]ladies,   [D]
R[Bm]ock-a-bye sw[G]eet baby Ja[D]mes,
D[Bm]eep greens and bl[G]ues are the co[D]lors I choose,
Won't you [E7sus]let me go down in my d[Asus]reams,
And r[G]ock-a-by [A7sus]sweet baby J[D]ames.

Well the [D]first of Dece[A]mber was covered with [G]snow,[F#m]
And so was the [Bm]turnpike from[D] Stockbridge to Bos[F#m]ton,
The [Bm]Birkshires seemed dream[G]-like on account [D]of that frostin'[F#m],
With[G]ten miles be[D]hind me and ten th[A]ousand more[Em] to go[A]

There's a [G]song that they sing when [Asus]they take to the h[D]ighway,
A song [Bm]that they sing when [D]they take to the[A] sea,
A song[G] that they sing of their [Asus]home in the [D]sky,
Maybe you[Bm] can believe[G] it, if it helps[D] you to sleep,
But[E7sus] singing[E7] works just fine for [A]me.

{Chorus}
