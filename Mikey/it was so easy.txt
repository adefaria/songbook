It Was So Easy - from No Secrets 1972

      C
I remember a time
  F
Rompin' through the woods
G                                  C
Sun against our skin instead of clothes
When we felt hungry we would eat
          F
When we felt glad we would dance
         G                            C
And whenever we felt drowsy we would doze

            F
It was so easy then
        Bb
Never takin' any stands
            F
It was so easy then
          G
Holdin' hands
    
      C        
I remember a time
           F
When our fears could be named
       G                         C
And courage meant not refusing dares
                                             F
I remember when we took such cares to step never on the cracks
No only on the squares
     G
Or else we'd be abducted by the bears

           F
It was so easy then
        Bb
Never makin' any plans
           F
It was so easy then
          G
Holdin' hands
           F
It was so easy then
        Bb
Never makin' any plans
           F
It was so easy then
          G
Holdin' hands

     C
And now we are grown
       F
With debts and regrets
      G
And broken hearts
                   C
And sentimental schemes
Now every tender failure
               F
Seems to overthrow old dreams
           G                        C
Love can drive a normal woman to extremes

           F
It was so easy then
        Bb
Never takin' any stands
            F
It was so easy then
          G
Holdin' hands
 
It was so easy then
          C     G    C
Holdin' hands
