INTRO: C E7 A7 Dm A7 Dm F D7 C A7 D7 G7

C      E7                   A7
Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Dm         A7                      Dm
Spent all my money, didn't have any cares
F          D7      C                 A7
Took all my friends out for a mighty good time
D7                                    G7
We bought bootleg liquor, champagne and wine

C        E7        A7
Then I began to fall so low
Dm                  A7                  Dm
Lost all my good friends had nowhere to go
F        D7            C          A7
If I get my hands on a dollar again
D7                                        G7
I'm gonna hang on it 'till that old eagle grins, cause...

C      E7   A7
Nobody knows you
Dm      A7           Dm
When you're down and out
F     D7     C          A7
In your pocket, not one penny
D7                                 G7
And as for friends, well, you ain't got any
C      E7                       A7
When you finally get back on your feet again
Dm               A7               Dm
Everybody wants to be your long lost friend
F              D7       C          A7
I said it's strange, without any doubt
D7                           G7
Nobody knows you when you're down and out


SOLO: verse 2x

Dm     A7           Dm
When you're down and out
F     D7       C          A7
In your pocket, not one penny
D7                               G7
And as for friends, well, you aint got any
C           E7                   A7
When you get back on your feet again
Dm            A7                      Dm
Everybody wants to be your old long lost friend
