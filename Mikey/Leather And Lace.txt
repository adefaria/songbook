Leather And Lace" – Stevie Nicks

[D] Is love so [D CBass] fragile
[Edim7] And the heart so [D] hollow
[G] Shatter with [G F#Bass] words
[Asus4] Impossible to [A] follow
[D] You're saying I'm [d Cbass] fragile
[Edim7] I try not to [D] be
I search [G] only
For [G F#Bass] something
I can't [Asus4 to A] see

[D] I have my own[D CBass]  life
[Edim7]And I am [D] stronger
Than you [G] know [G F#Bass] [Asus4 to A]
[D] But I get this [D CBass] feeling
[Edim7] When you walked in [D] to my house
[G] That you won't be [G F#Bass] walking out the [Asus4 to A] door
[D] Still I get this [D CBass] feeling
[Edim7] When you walked in [D] to my house
[G] That you won't be [G F#Bass] walking out the 
[Asus4 to A] door

[Walk up E- F#-G] Lovers [A] forever
[G] Face to [A] face
[G] My city or [A] mountains
[G] Stay with me [A] stay
[G] I need you to [G] love me
[G] I need you [A] today
[G] Give to me your [A] leather
Take [G} from me
My [Asus4 to A] lace

You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
[D] Sometimes I'm a [D Bass] strong man
[Edim7] Sometimes cold and [D] scared
And sometimes [G] I cry [G F#Bass] [Asus4 to A]
[D] But that time I [D CBass] saw you
[Edim7] I knew with [D] you to light my [G] nights
[G F#Bass]Somehow I'd get [Asus4 to A] by

Repeat Chorus 2X
Take [G} from me
My [Asus4 to A] lace
Take [G} from me
My [Asus4 to A] lace
