It's A Lovely Day

It's a lovely day
Look at all the sunshine
It's a lovely day
Have a drink of moonshine
Look at all our friends
Soaking up the good times
But today ain't half as lovely as it would be here with you
(No no no)
(No no no)

It's a lovely day
Friends to be together
What a lovely time
Talk about the weather
Have a drink of wine yeah
Feel like a feather
But today aint half as lovely as it would be here with you
No today ain't half as lovely as it would be here with you


[G]                                 [A]
Ever since the first day I met you honey
[G]                              [D]
I know you and I could learn to love
[G]                                  [D]
Please don't let the hesitations get you
[E]                              [A]     
C'mon darling our love needs to show

It's a lovely day
Smiles on all our faces
It's a lovely day
Friendship leaves its traces
Have a happy time yeah
We found an oasis
But today aint half as lovely as it would be here with you
No no no
No no no
Oh oh yea
Lovely now
Lovely now
Lovely lovely lovely
