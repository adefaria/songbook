(Intro)
[Em]                          [Am]
Ah - Ha (it's) all in my mind
[Em7] [Am9] [Em9] [Am7]           [Em7] [Am7]
(Guitar Riff x 2 )
 
(Chorus)
[Am7]             [Bm7]
Summer breeze makes me feel fine,
[Cmaj7]              [D11]             [Gmaj7] [Em7]  [Am7]
blowing through the jasmine in my mind.
[Am7]             [Bm7]
Summer breeze makes me feel fine,
[Cmaj7]                [D11]           [Gmaj7]
blowing through the jasmine in my mind,
          [F#m]  [B7]
all in my mind
 
(Verse)
[E]                [G]
See the curtains hanging in the window
[D]              [A]           [E]     [G]
In the evening on a Friday night
[E]                [G]
A little light a-shining through the window
[D]                  [A]              [E]    [E7]
Lets me know that everything?s alright. Oh Summer
 
(Chorus) 
 
(Verse)
Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom.
July is dressed up and playing her tune.
            [D11]           [E11]
When I come home from a hard days work,
           [Cmaj7]               [D11]          [B11] [B7]
and you're waiting there, not a care in the world.
 
(Verse)
See the smile waiting in the kitchen  
Food cooking on the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through - ooh
 
(Chorus)

(OUT) 
Am7 Dm9 Am9 Dm7         Am9   Dm7
Opening Riff x 2   part riff with heavily pulled notes
 
Oh Summer Breeze and Solos over Am7 Dm7
