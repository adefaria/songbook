From a Distance - Julie Gold
From a d[G]istance, the w[C]orld looks b[D]lue and g[G]reen 
And the s[C]now capped m[D]ountains w[G]hite
From a d[G]istance, the o[C]cean m[D]eets the s[G]tream
And the e[C]agle t[D]akes to f[G]light [C][D]

From a d[C]istance, t[D]here is h[Em]armony
And it e[C]choes t[G]hrough the l[D]and
It's the v[C]oice of h[G]ope, it's the v[C]oice of p[G]eace
It's the v[C]oice of e[D]very m[G]an  
From a distance, we all have enough
And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs, no disease
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance, we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every ma[G]n 
God is w[C]atching u[D]s, God is w[G]atching u[Em]s
God is w[C]atching u[D]s, from a d[G]istance [C][D]

From a distance, you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance, I can't comprehend 
What all this fighting's for

From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man

And God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us, from a distance
Yeah God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us, from a distance
