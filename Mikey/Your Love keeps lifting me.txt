[D] [G]  [Em] [D]      

Your [D]love lifted me h[G]igher
Than I've e[Em]ver been lifted bef[D]ore
So keep i[D]t up, quench my[G] desire
And I'll b[Em]e at your side forev[D]er more

You know your l[D]ove (your love keeps lifting me)
[G]Keeps on lifting (love keeps lifting me)
[Em]Higher (lifting me)
Higher and h[D]igher (higher and higher, higher)

I said your l[D]ove (your love keeps lifting me)
[G]Keeps on lifting (love keeps lifting me)
[Em]Higher (lifting me)
Higher and [D]higher (higher and higher higher) I said

Now once, I was downhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But then you came and he soon departed
And you know he never showed his face again

Thatâ€™s why my love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keeps on lifting (love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher and higher, higher) I said

I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keeps on lifting (love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher and higher, higher)(all right)

[D] [G] [Em] [D]  2x

I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes, that one in a million girls
And now with my loving' arms around you, honey
I can stand up and face the world
(Chrois) 2X

Oh, now sock it to me (your love keeps lifting me)
All right, lift me, oh, woman (love keeps lifting me)
Keep my life going' now (lifting me)
Higher and higher
I said, keep on lifting . . .
