GO AND SAY GOODBYE


VERSE 1:
        G                Em               F                G
You ask me to read this letter that you wrote the night before
         G                 F                    C                D
And you really should know better 'cause she's worth a whole lot
more

CHORUS:
        G        C         G     C       G   C   G
Brother you know you can't run away and hide
                C    B/bass   Am Am7  D           D7
Is it you don't want to      see her cry is that why
          G      C        G  C  G  C  G
You won't go and say goodbye

VERSE 2:
          G                F              C             D
Then you said the fault was yours and you really were to blame
       G                F            C            D
Was as if to close the doors and to hide away in shame

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE:
        A7                        D                 G
Yes and why tell me why can't you see that it's not right
       A7                               D       Dsus    D
It's a lie, it's a lie, don't hide your sorrows in the night

REPEAT CHORUS

INTERLUDE
      G                F               C              D
And I know the pain is double, but for her it's even worse
          G                 F                    C              D
You must face her with her trouble, though it's hurting like a curse

REPEAT CHORUS TWICE
G       C        G       C        G      C        G  G
Go and say good, go and say good, go and say goodbye
