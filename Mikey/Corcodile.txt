{title:Crocodile man} 

[A][G][G][A]
 
Mama she raised me on riddles and trances   
Fatback, channel-cat, lily white lies  
Rocked my cradle in a jimmy-crack fancy   
Never met papa and I never asked why 
 
And people say papa wasn't no account anyway  
People say papa was a rollin' stone  
I turned twenty on the Waccamaw throughway  
Hitchin' upriver in the dark alone

Sleepin' with a stranger in a no name town  
Thanksgivin' dinner at the Top Hat Lounge  
Christmas Eve at the Fantasy Tan  
Lord have mercy on the crocodile man  
Lord have mercy on the crocodile man   
 
Well I hooked up with a carny, little out of Memphis  
Slavin' in a side show, pennies in a jar  
Beetle-eyed jokers and hick town princes  
Rhinestone rubies and rubber cigars   
 
Wrassled me a gator up in Omaha City  
Did me another down in New Orleans  
Tangled with the barker, ran off with the kitty  
Crawled the Mississippi and I got away clean   
 
{Refrain}   
 
Underneath the levee in a cattail thicket  
Hidden in the shadow of a shady grove  
There's a thatched roof risin' from a poke fence picket  
White smoke billows from a kettle black stove   
 
Inside the house is the hall of mirrors  
Inside the mirror is the temple of sin  
Inside the temple is the face of mama  
And mama she knows just where I been  
Yeah, mama know exactly where her bad boy been – huh  ...
