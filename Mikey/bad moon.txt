{title:Bad Moon Rising mike}

[D] [A] [G]

I see the bad moon a-rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today
(Chorus)
I hear hurricanes a-blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers over flowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
(Chorus)
(Break)
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
(Chorus X2)
