Hey Hey Hey - Delta Rae
[E]Hey, hey, hey, [A]Don't you wanna [E] love me now, baby?
[E]Hey, hey, hey, [A]Ain't you think' 'bout [E] me?
[C#m] I've been tr[B]yin' to [A] get you off of my [E] mind for some time[E] 
now.
[A] Ain't goin' [C#m]well, [B] bab[E]y.
[E] Ain't much room left, babe, [A] between these four walls.
[E] Our hearts have grown as heavy as [A] cannonballs [B] .
[C#m] I tried to [B] love you, babe, and I'm [A] tryin' [E] still.
I've [E] always [B] loved you, babe, and I [A] always [E] will.
[E] The neighbor's dogs are chained; they don't [A] bark no more.
[E] Nothin' happens here that's [A] worth yellin' [B] for.
[C#m] But there'd be [B] music, babe, if we [A] ever walked [E] by.
[E] You know we'd [B] wake the world, if we [A] only [E] tried.
And I say,
[E]Hey, hey, hey, [A]Don't you wanna [E] love me now, baby?
[E]Hey, hey, hey, [A]Ain't you think' 'bout [E] me?
[C#m] I've been tr[B]yin' to [A] get you off of my [E] mind for some time[E] 
now.
[A] Ain't goin' [C#m]well, [B] bab[E]y.
[A] Won't you think about [C#m] [B] lovin' [E]me?
[E] Your window's open, babe, but your [A] doors are closed.
[E] You want a breeze to sweep in and [A] shake your [B] bones.
[C#m] But the sky is [B] clear as day and the [A] air is [E] cold.
So, [E] come on out and play; I'm not [B] here [A] that [E] long.
[E] 'Cuz, the times are tough, now, babe, but there [A] ours to own.
Ooh ooh ooh
[E] Make the most of it and [A] just stay at [B] home.
[C#m] I've come by [B] once, and I won' [A] be back [E] again.
Aw [E] who'm I kiddin', babe? Won't you [B] let [A] me [E] in!
And I say,
[E]Hey, hey, hey, [A]Don't you wanna [E] love me now, baby?
[E]Hey, hey, hey, [A]Ain't you think' 'bout [E] me?
[C#m] I've been tr[B]yin' to [A] get you off of my [E] mind for some time[E] 
now.
[A] Ain't goin' [C#m]well, [B] bab[E
