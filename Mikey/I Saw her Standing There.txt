{title:I Saw Her Standing There}

            E7                     A7          E7
Well she was just seventeen and you know what I mean
                                      B7
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
   E           E7           A7    Am/C
So how could I dance with another oh,
       E7      B7       E7
when I saw her standing there


[Verse]

     E7                      A7      E7
Well she looked at me and I, I could see
                                           B7
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
E            E7           A7
She wouldn't dance with another
Am/C          E7      B7       E7
Oh,  when I saw her standing there


[Chorus]
 
       A7
Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room
                       B7         A7
and I held her hand in mine


[Verse]

        E7
Well we danced through the night
       A7              E7
and we held each other tight
                                        B7
And before too long I fell in love with her
    E          E7         A7
Now I'll never dance with another
Am/C        E7        B7       E7
Oh, since I saw her standing there
