{title:The A Team}

Intro
[G] [D] [Em][C] [G]
        
[G]
White lips, pale face,
               [D]   [Em]
Breathing in snowflakes,
              [C]    [G]
Burnt lungs, sour taste.
[G]
Light's gone, day's end
               [D]    [Em]
Struggling to pay rent,
               [C]     G
Long nights, strange men.

(Refrain)
[Am]                            [Cadd9]
And they say she's in the Class A Team,
              [G]
Stuck in her daydream,
                     [D]                  [Am]
Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems
                  [Cadd9]
Slowly sinking, wasting
                [G]
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
     [D]
The worst things in life come free to us,
          [Em]              [Cadd9]
Cuz we're just under the upper hand
[G]
And go mad for a couple of grams
[Em]                  Cadd9    [G]
And she don't want to go outside tonight
           [Em]                    Cadd9
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
  [G]
Or sells love to another man,
[Em]        [Cadd9]    [G]
It's too cold outside
    [D/F#]       [Em]      [C]    [G]
For angels to fly
            [Em]      [C]    [G]
Angels to fly

(



Verse)
Ripped gloves, and raincoat,
Tried to swim and stay afloat,
Dry house, wet clothes.
Loose change, bank notes,
Weary-eyed, dry throat,
Call girl, no phone.

(Refrain)
               [C]
An angel will die.
              [Em]
Covered in white,

Closed eye,
     [G]
And hoping for a better life,
  [Am]                        [C]
This time, we'll fade out tonight
                   [Em]  [C]  [G]
Straight down the line
[Em][C] [G]
    
(Out)
     [D]        [Em]   [C]    [G]
For angels to fly
            [Em]  [C]  G
Angels to fly
   [Em]  [C]   [G]
To fly, fly
           [Em]      [C]       [G]
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
[D]          [G]
Angels to die.
