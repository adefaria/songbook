[A7sus4]Silently closing her b[A]edroom door   
[A7sus4]Leaving the note that she h[A]oped would say more
       
She goes [D]downs[am]tairs to the [Em7]kitchen clutchi[Bm7]ng a han[Bm7]dkerchief [E7]
[A7sus4]Quietly turning the b[A]ackdoor key 
[A7sus4]Stepping outside she is f[A]ree

[Bm7]She is leaving home after [E7]living alone for so [Bm7]many years

[D][Am]Father snores as his w[E7]ife gets into her [Bm7]dressing gown,[E7]  
[A7sus4]Picks up the letter that's l[A]ying there.
[A7sus4]Standing alone at the t[A]op of the stairs,

She breaks [D]down and [Am]cries to her [Em7]husband Daddy our [Bm7]baby’s gone [E7]
[A7sus4]Why would she treat us so [A]thoughtlessly?
[A7sus4]How could she do this to [A]me?

[A7sus4]Waiting to keep the ap[A]pointment she made
[A7sus4]Meeting a man from the [A]motor trade

[D]She - what did we do that was wrong?                
[D]Is having - we didn't know it was wrong             
[D]Fun - fun is the o[Am7]ne thing that money can't buy
[Bm7]Something inside that was [E7]always denied for so [Bm7]many years [E7]
[Bm7]She’s leaving [E7]home  bye b[G]ye  [D]
