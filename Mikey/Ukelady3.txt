
{Title:Ukele Lady}

(Intro)
I saw the splendor of the moonlight on Honolulu Bay

There's something tender in the moonlight on Honolulu Bay

And all the beaches are full of peaches
Who bring their ukes along

And in the glimmer of the moonlight
They love to sing this song
(verse1)
If you like a ukulele lady
Ukulele lady like a you

If you like to linger where it's shady
Ukulele lady linger too
(verse 2)
If you kiss a ukulele lady
While you promise ever to be true

And she see another ukulele lady
Lady fool around with you

(Bridge)
Maybe she'll sigh, maybe she'll cry
Maybe she'll find somebody else, by,by,by and by
     
To sing to when it's cool and shady
Where the tricky wickie wackies woo

If you like a ukulele lady
Ukulele lady like a you

(Break To verse)
(Bridge)
Well, maybe she will sigh, maybe she will cry
maybe she will find somebody else, by and by
(verse 3)
To sing to when it's cool and shady
Where the tricky wicky wackies woo

If you like a ukulele lady
Ukulele lady like a you 

(outro)
She used to sing to me by moonlight on Honolulu bay
Fond memories cling to me by moonlight
Although I'm far away

Some day I'm going where eyes are glowing
And lips are made to kiss
To see somebody in the moonlight and hear the song I miss
(Repeat verse 1)
