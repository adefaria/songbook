I’m An Old Cowhand


D      Bm7    Em7  G/B A7         Edim   D    G   D
I'm an old cowhand        from the Rio Grande,

D      Bm7        Em7  G/B A7        Edim         D    G   D
But my legs ain't bowed      and my cheeks ain't tanned;

       Bm              F#m
I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow --

       Bm                     F#m
Never roped a steer, 'cause I don't know how,

      Bm                    F#m
And I sure ain't fixin' to start in now.

D        Em7 G/B  A7+5   D Bm7  D      Em7   G/B A7+5   D
Yippie - yi - yo - ki - yay,   yippie - yi - yo - ki - yay.

I'm an old cowhand       from the Rio Grande,

D      Bm7       Em7  G/B A7         Edim       D    G   D
And I learned to ride       'fore I learned to stand;

      Bm                F#m
I'm a ridin' fool who is up to date --

       Bm                  F#m
I know every trail in the Lone Star state,

         Bm                  F#m
'Cause I ride the range in a Ford V8.

D        Em7 G/B  A7+5   D Bm7  D      Em7   G/B A7+5   D
Yippie - yi - yo - ki - yay,   yippie - yi - yo - ki - yay.

D      Bm7    Em7  G/B A7        Edim      D    G   D
And I came to town       just to hear the band;

       Bm                     F#m
I know all the songs that the cowboys know

          Bm                   F#m
'Bout the big corral where the dogies go,

          Bm                     F#m
'Cause I learned them all on the rad-ee-o

D        Em7 G/B  A7+5   D Bm7  D      Em7   G/B A7+5   D
Yippie - yi - yo - ki - yay,   yippie - yi - yo - ki - yay.
