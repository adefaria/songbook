{title:Sixteen Tons} 
 
[Em]Some people say a man is [C7]made outa [B7]mud  
[Em]A poor man's made outa [C7]muscle 'n [B7]blood...  
[Em]Muscle an' blood an' [Am]skin an' bone  
[Em]A mind that's weak and a [B7]back that's s[Em]trong         
 
You load sixteen tons an' whaddya get?            
Another day older an' deeper in debt       
Saint Peter doncha call me 'cause I can't go          
I owe my soul to the company store   
(Chorus) 
If ya hear me a-comin' ya better step aside  
A lotta men din't an' a lotta men died  
With one fist of iron an' the other of steel  
If the right one don' getcha then the left one will.  
(Chorus)  
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine  
Picked up my shovel and I went to the mine  
Loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal  
And the strawboss said, "Well, Bless my soul!"   
(Chorus) 
I was born one morning in the drizzlin' rain  
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name  
I was raised in the canebreak by an' ol' mama hound  
Ain't no high-tone woman gonna push me around. 
(Chorus)
