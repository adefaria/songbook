[Dmaj7]                     [G]
Hey, who's that stompin' all over my face
[Dmaj7]                     [G]
Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace
[Dmaj7]                     [G]
Who's puttin' sponge in the bells I once rung
[Dmaj7]              [G]
And taken my gypsy before she's begun

   [Bm]                   [Em]
To singin' the meanin' of what's in  my mind
  [Bm]                        [Em]
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine
[Bm]                        [Em]
Joinin' and a-listenin' and talkin' in rhymes
[Bm]                    [Em]
Stoppin' the feelin' to wait for the time

[G]                       [A]
Who's sayin' babe, that I don't mean a thing
       [Bm]      [D]    [E]  [F#m]     [Bm]
'Cause nowadays, Clancy can't     even sing

[Dmaj7]  [G] (Repeat)

[Dmaj7]                       [G]
And who's all hung up on that happiness thing
[Dmaj7]                      [G]
Who's tryin' to tune all the bells that he rings
[Dmaj7]                     [G]
And who's in the corner and down on the floor
[Dmaj7]                    [G]
With pencil and paper just countin' the score

    [Bm]                      [Em]
And who's gonna act like he's just in between
    [Bm]                     [Em]
The night isn't black if you know that it's green
[Bm]                         [Em]
Don't bother lookin', you're too blind to see
[Bm]                     [Em]
Who's comin' home like he wanted to be


[G]                       [A]
Who's sayin' babe, that I don't mean a thing
       [Bm]      [D]    [E]  [F#m]     [Bm]
'Cause nowadays, Clancy can't     even sing

[Dmaj7]  [G] (Repeat)

[Dmaj7]                     [G]
And who's comin' home on old 95
[Dmaj7]                        [G]
Who's got the feelin' there to keep in line
[Dmaj7]                      [G]
Though havin' it, sharin' it ain't quite the same
[Dmaj7]                       [G]
To paint a golden nugget, you can't lay a claim

[Bm]                          [Em]
Who's seein' eyes through the crack in the floor
[Bm]                        [Em]
There it is baby, don't you worry no more
[Bm]                          [Em]
Who should be sleepin' what's writin' this song
[Bm]                    [Em]
Wishin' and a-hopin' he weren't so damn long


[G]                       [A]
Who's sayin' babe, that I don't mean a thing
       [Bm]      [D]    [E]        [Bm]
'Cause nowadays, Clancy can't even sing

[G]                       [A]
Who's sayin' babe, that I don't mean a thing
       [Bm]      [D]    [E]  [F#m]     [Bm]
'Cause nowadays, Clancy can't     even sing

Hold on [Dmaj7]
