When You Say Nothing At All – Alison Krauss


[D] It's [A] amazing how [G] you can speak [A] right to my [D] heart [A-G-A]
[D] Without [A] saying a [G] word you can [A] light up the [D] dark [A-G-A]
[G] Try as I may I could [A] never explain
[D] What I [A] hear when you [G] don't say a [A] thing

[D] The smile on your [A] face lets me [G] know that you [A] need me
There's a [D] truth in your [A] eyes sayin' [G] you'll never [A] leave me
The [D] touch of your [A] hand says you'll [G] catch me if ever I [A] fall [G-A]
[G] You say it best [A] when you say nothing at [D] all [A-G-A]

Instrumental (Verse)

[D] All day [A] long I can [G] hear people [A] talking out [D] loud [A-G-A]
[D] But when [A] you hold me [G] near, you [A] drown out the [D] crowd [A-G-A]
[G] Old Mr. Webster could [A] never define
[D] What's being [A] said between [G] your heart and [A] mine

[D] The smile on your [A] face lets me [G] know that you [A] need me
There's a [D] truth in your [A] eyes sayin' [G] you'll never [A] leave me
The [D] touch of your [A] hand says you'll [G] catch me if ever I [A] fall [G-A]
[G] You say it best [A] when you say nothing at [D] all [A-G-A]
