You Say
By Douglas W. Fielder
[Am7] You Say, [G-HOF#] that you're [G] leaving again.
You say, you don't love me and then
[Dm]You tell me that you just don't [E] need me [E - add D]
As you're walking out the door.
I can't believe a word you're saying
Because I've heard it all before.....you say
They say, I should just let you go
They say, but they really don't know
They don't know just how I'm feeling
When I don't have you here to hold
My body shakes my mind is reeling
I feel so lonely and so cold...they say
 [Bm] Don't know why I keep on [C] falling for you
[G] We always break [D] apart
[Bm] It hurts so bad sometimes if [C] you only knew
[G] You always break my [D] heart, break my [E] heart

I say, I won't do this again
I say, it's a game I can't win
Then one day I find you standing
On the porch by my front door
You wrap those loving arms around me
And I melt just like before...I say
You say, that you love me again
You say, I should let you back in
then you tell me that you're sorry
You didn't mean a thing you said
You touch my face and kiss me gently
Then you pull me to the bed......and you say......you say......
