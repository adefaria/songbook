Don't Let Me Be Lonely - The Band Perry - Capo 6
I need a [G] saving grace
A [G] hiding place
I [D] don't have forever or [D] time to waste
So don't [Em] let me be lonely
I wanna [G] shake this winter coat off my sleeve
[D] Dust off a record and just be free
Oh don't [Em] let me be lonely
No don't [C] let me be lonely
When you're [C] young
You can [G] fly
But we [D] trip on clouds 'cause we [Em] get too high
[C] We grow [G] up
And then It's [Em] gone
Oh [C] God only knows what we'll become
So don't [C] let me be, let me be, let [G] me be lonely [D] tonight
[D] While we're young and alive
Take the [C] keys to my car and the [G] keys to my heart and just [D] drive
Oh don't let me, let me be [C] lonely
Well the [G] night rolls on like a long lost friend
'Til the [D] sunrise bleeds like the bitter end
Don't [Em] let me be lonely
Well there's [G] nothing to hide and nothing to prove
Give me [D] all that you are
You've got nothing to lose
Just don't [Em] let me be lonely
No don't [C] let me be lonely
So don't [C] let me be, let me be, [G] let me be lonely [D] tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the [C] keys to my car and the [G] keys to my heart and just [D] drive
Oh don't let me, let me be [C] lonely
[C] [G] [D] [repeat for lead] No -- Don't let me be
When you're [C] young
Life's a [G] dream
It's a [D] beautiful and a [Em] burning thing
[C]We grow [G]up
And then it's [Em] gone 
But the [D] memory goes on and [C] on and on and on and on and on and on
So don't [C] let me be, let me be, let [G] me be lonely [D] tonight
While we're young and alive
[C] Take the keys to my car and the [G] keys to my heart and just [D] drive
Oh don't let me, let me [C] be lonely [C] [G] [D] [Repeat to end]
