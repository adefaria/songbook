[intro]
 
[G]You come home late and you come home e[C]arly
[D]You come on big when you're feeling smal[G]l
[G]You come home straight and you come home c[C]urly
[D]Sometimes you d[D7]on’t come home at [G]all.
(CHORUS)
 
[G]So what in the w[G]orld’s come o[C]ver you
[D]And what in heaven's name have you d[G]one.
[G]You’ve broken the sp[G]eed of the sound of lo[C]neliness
[D]You’re out there [D7]running just to be on the r[G]un.
 
Well I got a heart that burns with a fever,
And I got a worried and a jealous mind.
How can a love that'll last forever,
Get left so far behind.
(Chorus) 
(Break)
 
It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow,
It's crossed the evil line today.
How can you ask about tomorrow,
We ain't got one word to say.
(CHORUS) 
You're out there running just to be on the run X3
