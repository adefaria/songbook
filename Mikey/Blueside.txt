VERSE 1/2:
[Bm]The colors h[Bm/A]ave built up in[Bm/G#] my mind
They[G]’re blee[F#]ding thro[Bm]ugh my heart
[Bm]But nobo[Bm/A]dy knows that[Bm/G#] they exist
[G]Look at [F#]my burs[Bm]ting veins
Now do[Bm/A] you see the[Bm/G#] red in me
[G]Its a s[F#]ign for t[B]he end

CHORUS:
[B]Only th[Dm]e end of [C#m]the red
[F#]Will show you my blueside
[B]Only th[Dm]e end of [C#m]the red
[F#]Will show you my blueside

VERSE 2:
I’ve been given my brush and plate
Where will I paint my life
And will the buyer in the sky
Believe in what I dream
It’s so hard for me to explain
What I will miss to myself
