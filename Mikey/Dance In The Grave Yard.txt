Dance In The Grave Yard       

Whe[E]n I die, I don't want to rest in peace, I want to dance in joy           
I want to dance[B] in the graveyards, the graveyards
An[E]d while I'm alive, I don't want to be alone 
Mourning the ones who came before
I want to danc[B]e with them some more, le[E]t's dance in the graveyards
Melody 2:
[E]Gloria, like some other name we kept on calling ya and waiting for change
But[B] I belong to all of your mysteries
An[E]d all of us, we're meant for the fire
But we keep rising up and walking the wires
So whe[B]n we go below, don't lose us in mourning
Melody 1:
'Cause w[E]hen I die, I don't want to rest in peace, I want to dance in joy
I want to dance[B] in the graveyards, the graveyards

Mourning the ones who came before
I want to danc[B]e with them some more, l[E]et's dance in the graveyards (whoa-oh)
Let's dance in the grave[B]yards (whoa-oh)
Melody 3:
[A]Oh, my love, [E]don't cry when I'm gone
I will [A]lift you up, t[E]he air in your lungs
And whe[B]n you reach f[E]or me, we'll d[B]ance in the darkness
Melody 2:
And we [E]will walk beyond - our daughters and sons
They will carry on like when we were young
And we [B]will stand beside and breathe in their new life
Melody 1:
'Cause wh[E]en I die, I don't want to rest in peace, I want to dance in joy
I want to dance[B] in the graveyards, the graveyards
An[E]d while I'm alive, I don't want to be alone
Mourning the ones who came before
I want to danc[B]e with them some mor[E]e, let's dance in the graveyards (whoa-oh)
Let's dance in the grave[B]yards (whoa-oh)
