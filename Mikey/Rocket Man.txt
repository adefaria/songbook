       Rocket Man
       Em7                                  		A9
         She packed my bags last night - pre-flight
         Em7               A9
         Zero hour, nine A.M.
         C                G         Am      		D
         And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
         Em7                         			A9
         I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
         Em7                 A9
         It's lonely out in space
         C         G        Am       D
         On such a timeless flight as this

                   G                                     		C
         CHORUS:   And I think it's gonna be a long long time
                                                     G
                   Til touchdown brings me 'round to find
                                                      C
                   I'm not the man they think I am at home
                              	G         A9
                   Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
                   C                              G
                   Rocket man, burnin' out his up here alone

         Em7                           A9
         Mars ain't the kinda place to raise your kids
         Em7                  A9
         In fact it's cold as hell
         C                   G       Am                D
         And there's no one there to raise them if you did
         Em7                               A9
         And all this science, I don't understand
         Em7                         A9
         It's just my job five days a-week
         C        G  Am          D
         Rocket man - - - rocket man

         CHORUS:
