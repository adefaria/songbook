 [A7]Just let me hear some of that...

[Chorus]
[D]Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a b[G]ack beat, you can't lose it
[D]Any old time you use it
It's g[A7]otta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with [D]me
[A7]If you wanna dance with [D]me

[Verse 1]
I have no kick against [A]modern jazz
[A7]Unless you try to play it [D]too darn fast
I lose the beauty of a m[G]elody
Until it sounds just like a [A7]symphony
That's why I go for that...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I took my love on over 'cross[A] the tracks
[A7]So she could hear a man a-wa[D]ilin' sax
I must admit they had a roc[G]kin' band
And they were blowin' like a [A7]hurrican'
That's why I go for that...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Way down south they gave a jub[A]ilee
[A7]And Georgia folks, they had a j[D]amboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a w[G]ooden cup
The folks dancin' got all s[A7]hook up
And started playin' that...

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Don't get to hear 'em play a t[A]ango
[A7]I'm in no mood to take a m[D]ambo
It's way too early for the [G]congo
So keep on rockin' that [A7]piano
So I can hear some of that...

[Chorus]
