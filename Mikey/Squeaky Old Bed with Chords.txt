Squeaky Old Bed – Douglas W. FIelder
I got a [G] squeaky old bed and my neighbors don’t like it
[D] Especially since I met you
When we get [D] home late at night and turn off the light
You [G] know what they’re gonna do
They’re gonna [G] turn on the TV, [G] put on a movie
[G] get out the wireless head [A] phones
Cause [D] “Honey” we’ll be making our own sweet sound
Rocking to the Rolling [G] Stones……
[C] Squeaky Old Bed like a radio, [G] playing that rock and roll
[A] Squeaky Old Bed got a rhythm beat that [D] gets into your soul
The [C] more it squeaks the better I like it, [G] whether it’s fast or [A] slow
And the [D] very best part is you can’t change the volume, so everybody [G] knows…..
When we [G] travel round the country stay in cheap motels
We [D] know that we can’t can’t lose
They got the [D] squeakiest beds known to man
No [G] matter which room you choose
When we come [G] back from the pool in the afternoon
Put some [G] quarters in the “magic [A] fingers”
The [D] maids will be laughing as they’re pushing their carts 
Listening to the afternoon [G] “squeakers”

[C] Squeaky Old Bed like a radio, [G] playing that rock and roll
[A] Squeaky Old Bed got a rhythm beat that [D] gets into your soul
The [C] more it squeaks the better I like it, [G] whether it’s fast or [A] slow
And the [D] very best part is you can’t change the volume, so everybody [G] knows…..
When we got [G] home last week the delivery man
Had a [D] brand new bed for us
When I [D] asked him who bought it, he didn’t know
So [G] I called up his boss.
He told me [G} “half of the people in your [G] complex
pitched in to buy this brand new [A] bed
I [D] thanked him and I told that delivery man
To  take it to the Goodwill [G] instead

[C] Squeaky Old Bed like a radio, [G] playing that rock and roll
[A] Squeaky Old Bed got a rhythm beat that [D] gets into your soul
The [C] more it squeaks the better I like it, [G] whether it’s fast or [A] slow
And the [D] very best part is you can’t change the volume, so everybody [G] knows…..
