Hyperman

I’m trapped inside my body
A prisoner I guess
I’ll have one cup of coffee and you can keep the rest

I’ve got blisters on my brain cells 
cause every things moving fast 
better stop a spell the roses cause this day might be my last

I am hyper hyper hyper man
Why I act this way you can’t understand
If you see me start to shaking better get out of the road 
There a short fuse on fire and i just might explode

Some times you make me nervous, anxious and start to sweat
Maybe I don’t trust you or maybe you won the bet
Money fuels a sedation that the walls are caving in
I can;t imagine second place I just got to win

Train chugging faster and I’m tired onto the tracks
I’m waiting for my hero to make the ropes go laps
but whistle is sounding closer and there is still no one around
I know this isn’t heaven because I’m stuck here on the ground

I am hyper hyper hyper man
Why I act this way you can’t understand
If you see me start to shaking better get out of the road 
There a short fuse on fire and i just might explode
