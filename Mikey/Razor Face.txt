Has a[C7/E]nybody here seen [F]Razor Face
I [Am]heard he's back [Dm]looking for a place to l[E7]ay down[Eb]

[F]  Needs a man who's [Am]young to w[C7/E]alk him r[F]ound
[C/E]Needs a man who's yo[F]ung to walk him ro[Am7]und

Oh it [C6/E]must be hard for the l[F]ikes of you
[Am]To get by in a [Dm]world that you just can't se[Em]e through[Eb]And it looks so c[Em7]old
[F]How does it f[Am]eel to know you c[Cm7/G]an’t g[C9/E]o   h[F]ome
[C/E]How does it f[F]eel to know you can't go h[Am7]ome

[G]Come on Ra[G7/F]zor Face my old fr[C/E]iend [F]
[G]I’ll meet you do[G7/F]wn by the truck stop [C/E]inn [F]
With a [Am]bottle of booze in the b[C7/G]ack of my car
You're a [F]song on the lips of a[F#]n aging star
[C/E]Razor Face, oh am[F]azing grace
Pro[C/E]tects you like a gl[F]ove
And I'll [Am]never learn the r[Dm]eason why
I [Bb]love yo[F]ur Razor Face
