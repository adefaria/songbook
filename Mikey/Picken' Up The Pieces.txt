Poco - Pickin' Up The Pieces

Chorus:
Well, there's ju[d]st a little bit o' magic
in the country mus[c]ic we're singin'
So let's [g]begin
We're[d] bringin' ya back down home
Where the fol[c]ks are happy
Sittin', pickin', ag]d a-grinnin'
Cas[Am]ually, you [D]and me
Will pick up[C] the pi[D]eces, uh-huh

Verse:
Someb[C]ody yelle[D]d out at me
Count[G]ry music a[C]nd company
Kinda [Em]makes it
On [C]a Sunday[D] afternoon
Picnic[C] lunches of[D] yesterday
Should still ha[]ve a place in y[E]our heart today
Think it[GEm] over
'Cause w[C]e'll all b[D]e going [C]hom[G
]e so soon

(Repeat Chorus)

If ya ha[C]d the time [D]to stay
Would ya[G] sit yourself down a[C]nd play
Country[Em] music
Singin'[C] songs that we both[D] knew
Lord, I[C] know that the day wil[D]l come
When the both of [G]us'll sit down[C] and strum
On our gu[Em]itars
And yo[C]u'll see I[D] really am[C] a lot like[G] you
