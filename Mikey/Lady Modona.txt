{title:Lady Madonna}

[A]Lady M[D]adonna, c[A]hildren at your [D]feet,
[A]Wonder how you m[D]anage [A]to [F]make [G]ends [A]meet?
[A]Who finds the m[D]oney [A]when you pay the [D]rent?
[A]Did you think that [D]money [A]was [F]hea-[G]ven s[A]ent?

[Dm]Friday night arrives without a [G]suitcase,
[C]Sunday morning creeps in like a [Am]nun.
[Dm]Mondayâ€™s child has learned to tie his [G7]bootlace,
[C]See [Dm]how they r[E7]un!


Lady Madonna, baby at your breast,
Wonder how you manage to[F] feed t[G]he r[A]est.

[Bridge]

[C]See h[Dm]ow they r[E7]un!

Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
[A]Listen to the m[D]usic playing [F]in [G]your [A]head.

[Dm]Tuesday afternoon is never e[A]nding,
[C]Wednesday morning papers didn't c[A]ome.
[Dm]Thursday night your stockings needed m[G7]ending.
[C]See h[Dm]ow they [E7]run!


[Outro]
[A]Lady [D]Madonna, [A]children at your [D]feet,
[A]Wonder how you m[D]anage [A]to [F]make e[G]nds [A]meet.
