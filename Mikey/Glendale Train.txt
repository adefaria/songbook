Charlie Jones was the engineer, 
he had twenty years on the line.
He kissed his wife at the station dear,
this morning at six thirty five
Every thing went fine till half past nine
when Charlie looked up and he saw.
Men on horses, men with guns, 
and no sign of the law.

Chorus.  (tag no words).

Amos White was the Luggage man,
and dearly loved his job.
The company rewarded him, 
with a golden watch and fob.
Well Amos he was workin' time
when the door blew off his car.
The found Amos White in fifteen pieces
Fifteen miles apart.
