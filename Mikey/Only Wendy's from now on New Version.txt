Only Wendy's from now on....
Douglas W. Fielder
[C7] Fell in love with my cousin when I was only 10.
[F] Her name was Wendy and I [C7] didn't know it then.
But [G7] somewhere in the future I would [F] come to realize.
I would [C7] only date Wendy's it's really a surprise
[C7] I did not pursue my cousin, I didn't choose that path
Though I [F] happened to peek in once [C7] while she took a bath
[G7] Jerry Lee was not my style, though I [F]  loved to hear him play
[C7] And it's only the name Wendy, that sticks with me today
[F] Only Wendy's from now on...[C7] It's reason for this song
[G7] No Barbara's or Cindy's....I am [F] only dating [C7] Wendy's

[C7] My first real love with a Wendy happened late in life
I was [F] close to 60, with [C7] kids and an ex-wife
I [G7] really thought I loved her and was [F] ready to be wed
But she [C7] changed her name to Abigail and that romance was dead

I [C7] met another Wendy on the internet..
She was [F] cute and fun and we laughed a ton you [C7] know I would've bet
We'd [G7] spend our lives together and play [F] scrabble late at night
But when she [C7] tried to list my condo, I knew it wasn't right
Only [F] Wendy's from now on....[C7] It's the reason for this song....
[G7] No Abigail's or Cindy's....I am [F] only dating [C7] Wendy's

[C7] There may be lots of ladies out there improperly named
That's [F] not my fault, it's their parents and [C7] they should be ashamed.
They should [G7] run down to the courthouse and [F] file the paperwork
[C7]Change that name to Wendy before they marry some poor jerk

I'll keep [C7] looking for my "Wendy" til my dying day
[F] I may never find her, but [C7] that will be okay
As [G7]  long as I date Wendy's I will [F] always get it right
[C7] When I shout her name as we're making love in the middle of the night

Only [F] Wendy's from now on....[C7] I can shout it all night long....
[G7] No Abigail's or Cindy's....I am [F] only dating [C7] Wendy's
