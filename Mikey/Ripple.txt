[G]If my words did glow with the gold of sun[C]shine   
[C]And my tunes were played on the harp unst[G]rung     
[G]Would you hear my voice come through the m[C]usic  
[C]Would you ho[G]ld it n[D]ear a[C]s it were your o[G]wn?    
[G]It’s a hand-me-down, the thoughts are br[C]oken  
[C]Perhaps they're better left uns[G]ung  
[G]I don't know, don't really c[C]are  
Let there be songs to fill the a[G]ir    (4count)
 
[Am]Ripple in still w[D]ater  
When there is no pebble to[C]ssed   
Nor w[A]ind to b[D]low     
 
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty  
If your cup is full may it be again  
Let it be known there is a fountain  
That was not made by the hands of men. 
 There is a road, no simple highway  
Between the dawn and the dark of night  
And if you go no one may follow  
That path is for your steps alone    
 
Ripple in still water   
When there is no pebble tossed   
Nor wind to blow     

You who choose to lead must follow  
But if you fall you fall alone  
If you should stand then who's to guide you?  
If I knew the way I would take you home
