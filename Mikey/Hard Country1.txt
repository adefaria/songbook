Hard Country

T[G]here goes Bobby Ray, Ju[D/F#]nior, he[Em7]'s pullin’ out of town[C]
He's[G] got his family in a U-[D/F#]Haul, they’re all s[C]unbelt bound
A[G]nother farm ab[D/F#]andoned, they gave the la[Em7]nd back to the wi[C]nd
The price of fu[G]el went up, co[D/F#]rn went down
And I do[C]n’t think we’ll be seeing Bo[G]bby again.

It’s a h[G]ard co[D]untry, l[C]ast year the fields were all t[D]oo wet to plow
H[G]ard co[D]untry and t[C]his year they say that it l[[D]ooks like a drought
But I [Em7]can’t le[D/F#]ave 'cause my r[G]oots go d[C]eep in this [G]hard [D/F#] [Em7] [D/F#] co[G]untry.

I[G]’ve got a friend got a[D/F#] job in the city i[Em7]nstalling burglar a[C]larms
H[G]e says he’s makin’ r[D/F#]eal good money but I can t[C]ell he misses the farm
H[G]e calls to ask how the c[D/F#]rops are doin’, I[Em7] say we could use some r[C]ain
[G]Says his life is m[D/F#]ovin’ kinda fast and I t[C]ell him out here things are a[D]lways the same.

It’s a h[G]ard co[D]untry, l[C]ast year the fields were all t[D]oo wet to plow
H[G]ard co[D]untry and t[C]his year they say that it l[[D]ooks like a drought
But I [Em7]can’t le[D/F#]ave 'cause my r[G]oots go d[C]eep in this [G]hard [D/F#] [Em7] [D/F#] co[G]untry

Bridge
Well, the s[Am7]now piles up in the wi[Em7]nter and the [F]bugs come out in June
But s[Am7]omehow, it’s all wor[Em7]th it when I s[C]ee that harvest m[D]oon.

It’s a h[G]ard co[D]untry, l[C]ast year the fields were all t[D]oo wet to plow
H[G]ard co[D]untry and t[C]his year they say that it l[[D]ooks like a drought
But I [Em7]can’t le[D/F#]ave 'cause my r[G]oots go d[C]eep in this [G]hard [D/F#] [Em7] [D/F#] co[G]untry
