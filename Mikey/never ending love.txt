(Chorus)
[A]                  [D#]                   [A#]
I've got a never ending love for you
                              C
From now on that's all I wanna do
                            [A#]
From the first time we met I knew
                                [D#]
I'd have a never ending love for you
 
(Chorus)
       
I've got a never ending love for you                            
From now on that's all I wanna do                          
From the first time we met I knew
                                C      C7
I'd have a never ending love for you
 
(Verse)
     [G#]
After all this time of being alone
      [D#]                                             [G#]
We can love one another, live for each other from now on
[A#]
Feels so good, I can hardly stand it
 
(Chorus)

[D#] [A#] [D#]   [D#] [A#] [D#] X2
 
(Verse)
After all this time of being alone                                            
We can love one another, live for each other from now on
Feels so good, I can hardly stand it
 
(Chorus)
