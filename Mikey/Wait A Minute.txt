Wait a Minute

Chorus:
G 	    D
Wait A Minute
C                                            G
Did I hear you say you are going far away again
G 	  	 D
Try to change it
C                    	 Am                   D
I can't take the lonely nights without your love


G           D                                           
Due on the road to 
C 	  	  	  	 G
get the music done and move along
G                  D         
What good does it do
C 	  	  	 Am
 to play your songs for her
 	  	  	 D
and hear her say

Chorus

G        D 	   C
Roling along and lifes been good to you
G
But even so
G             D   C               	 Am 	  	 D 	  	 
She comes to you late at night is the time you hear her say
D
Once again

Chorus
G            D  C       	  	  	  	 G
Waiting for you 30 days and nights without a rest
G 	  	 D                  
I got to hold on 
C 	  	 Am
Twenty five to go
 	     D 	  	  	 G
And once again well  I hear her say...

Chorus
