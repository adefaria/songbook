Country House Delta Rae
Capo 3rd fret
Verse: D (x2)  B A G  D (x2)  A (x4)
     D                        B               A
In a country house with the windows lit by burning wicks
       G                 D                                      A
And the walls held up by wood and bricks and ghosts that wander through
An old man died, but the help won't come till Monday next
And he's gone to meet the architects of the only world he knew

Chorus: G (x2)  D (x2)  A (x4)
And he's lonesome
And he's lonesome

Verse: D (x2)  B A G  D (x2)  A (x4)
And the family mourned, at the wake he lay in front of them
Just as silent as he'd ever been to any young child's eyes
And by buried skin, they shed their laughter and their tears
The pain of all those early years where innocence had died

Chorus: G (x2)  D (x2)  A (x4)
But now they're lonesome
Yes they're lonesome

Verse/Bridge: G D Bm A
Memorials that we may build
They won't the holes forever fill
There is a deep and aching chill
That settles in our bones
In our bones

Chorus: G (x2)  D (x2)  A (x4)
'Cause we're lonesome
(Did you ever love somebody?
Did you ever lose someone?)
'Cause we're lonesome

Outro:
    D                         B            A
In a country house with the windows all lit up
