[Verse]

[Am]Sometimes wh[Asus4]en this plac[Fmaj7}]e gets kin[G]d of empty
 [Am]The sound of t[Asus4]heir voice f[Fmaj7]ades with [G]the light
 [Am]I think [Asus4]about the[Fmaj7] loveless f[G]acination
 [Am]Under t[Asus4]he Milky [Fmaj7]Way tonig[G]ht

Lower the curtains down on Memphis
Lower the curtains down alright
Iv'e got no time for private consultation
Under the milky way tonight


[Chorus]

[G]Wish I knew what [Fmaj7]you were looking for
[G]might have know[Fmaj7]n what you would find
[G]Wish I knew wha[Fmaj7]t you were looking for
[G]might have know[Fmaj7]n what you would find


And its somthing quite pecular
Something thats shimmering and white
It leads you here despite your destination
Under the milky way tonight

[Chorus]
