Oh[D], I'm Bein'followed by a [G]moon shado[D]w, moonshadow, moonshadow---

[D]Leapin and hoppin' on a[G] moonshad[D]ow, moonshadow, moonshadow---
    
An[G]d if I[D] eve[G]r lose [D]my ha[G]nds, l[D]ose my[Em] plough, [A7]lose my land,

Oh[G] if I [D]ever [G]lose m[D[y hand[Em]s, Oh[A7] if[D][Bm]I [Em]won’t hav[A7]e to wo[D]rk no more.
 
An[G]d if I [D]eve[G]r lose [D]my e[G]yes, i[D]f my c[Em]oloures [A7]all ran dry,
Ye[G]s if I [D]ever[G] lose [D]my eyes, [Em]Oh if[A7][D][Bm] I[Em] won't have[A7] to cry [D]no more.
 
Oh, I'm Bein'followed by a moon shadow, moonshadow, moonshadow---
Leapin and hoppin' on a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow---
 
And if i ever lose my legs, I won't moan, and I won't beg,
Yes if I ever lose my legs, Oh if-------------- I won't have to walk no 
more.
 
And if I ever lose my mouth, all my teeth, north and south,
Yes if I ever lose my mouth, Oh if-------------- I won't have to talk...
 
[E7]Did it take lon[A]g to find [E7]me?  I asked t[A]he faithful light.
[E7]Did it take lon[A]g to find[E7] me?  And are you[A] gonna stay [A7]the ni---------ght?
 
Oh, I'm Bein'followed by a moon shadow, moonshadow, moonshadow---
Leapin and hoppin' on a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow---
