Slow Horses – Douglas W. Fielder
E pullon A
[E] Slow horses and ugly old cowboys
[E] Old leather and rusty old spurs
[B7] Empty revolvers and emptier dreams
Big [Am9] coats made from wolverine [E] furs

[E] He’s trapped all the way to the Bering
[E] He’s ridden down Mexico way
[B7] His home now is just north of Anchorage
But that’s the [Am9] last place you’ll find him [E] today
	[B7] He’s having a drink at the old Paris Club
	The [Am9] only place he ever [E] goes
	He was [B7] just 21 when he walked down 5th Street
	Back [Am9] then you just followed your [E] nose

[E] Now he’s 80 and he’s still out their trapping
[E] But each day gets harder to take
[B7] The winters are getting too cold now
And [Am9] sometimes his old hands they just [E] shake

[E] He’s thinking tonight as he’s drinking
[E] Bout all of the land he just sold
[B7] He’s heading back down old Mexico way 
Where the [Am9] weather it never gets [E] cold
[B7] He’s tired of riding slow horses
And his [Am9] eyesight is starting to [E] fail
[B7] There’s once was a young senorita
Who kept him [Am9] out of a Mexican [E] jail

[A] He’s heading back to Pueblo [E] Nuevo
[G] That’s where he left her one [D] night
Just [Dm] before those damn Fede [A] rales
Could ar [E] rest him for starting a fight
[A] If he finds her again he’ll be [E] lucky
[G] If she takes him back he will be [D] blessed
If she’s [Dm] no longer there he’ll just [A] sit in the bar
and get [E] hammered with all of the rest
[B7] Slow horses and ugly old cowboys 
Is [Am9] not something he’ll have to [E] learn
At [B7] least he won’t freeze north of Anchorage
And this [Am9] time he’s got money to [E] burn
[E] Slow horses and ugly old cowboys
[E] Tequila straight up on the bar
[B7] She plays a song on the jukebox
And  [Am9] tells him how lucky they [E] are
