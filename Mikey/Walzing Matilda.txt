[D] [A] [D] [A]

[Verse 1]
[D]          [A]          [D]         [G]             
Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong
[D]                  [A] 
Under the shade of a cool bah tree
[D]        [A]                    [D]               [G]
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled,
[D]              [A]                [D]      
You`ll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me
        
[Chorus]
[D]                    [G]
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
[D]            [Bm]        [Em]            [A]
You`ll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me.
      [D]         [A]        [D]               [G]
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled,
  [D]    [A]       [D]      [A]     [D]  [A]  [D]  
You`ll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me.

[Verse 2]
Down came a jumbuck to drink at the billabong,
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee.
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag,
You`ll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me.
      
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred,
Up rode the troopers, one-two-three.
"Where`s that jolly jumbuck, you`ve got in your tucker bag 
You`ll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me. 

[Chorus
  
[Verse 4]     
Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong,         
You`ll never catch me alive, said he
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong,
You`ll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me   
     
[Chorus] X2
