Freedom - get goin’						
Lots to be learned and lots to be knowin’ ‘bout

Sit’em right down and then you gotta teach’em ‘bout
Freedom - gotta win it
Gotta put yourself smack dab in it

Love for - one another
Callin’ some friend and callin’ some brother

Chorus:
Hey tomorrow
You’re not so far away
Mother freeeeeedom
Will know you well someday
