[Verse]
[G]
Two of us riding nowhere 
                   [C]    [G/B]    [Am7]
Spending someone's Hard earned pay
[G]
You and me Sunday driving
                   [C]    [G/B]    [Am7]
Not arriving On our way back home
[D]            [C]   [G]
We're on our way home
[D]            [C]   [G]
We're on our way home
[C]            [G]
 We're going home
  
[Verse]
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters On my  wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
 We're going home
 
[Bb]                           [Dm]
You and I have memories
[Gm7]          [Am]                       [D7]
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Verse]
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
 
 
[Chorus]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
 
 
[Verse]
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
 We're going home
