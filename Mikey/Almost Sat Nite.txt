Almost Saturday Night
Folgerty
C            F 
  Outside my window 
C                F
  I can hear the radio
           C               Am                      Em
  And you know that motor wagon's getting ready to fly
             G               C
  Cause it's almost Saturday night

C          F
  Bye bye tomorrow 
C                     F
  Jody's gone to the rodeo
          C                  Am                Em
  And you know some good old boys are ready to ride
              G               F
  Cause it's almost Saturday night

                         C
  Gonna push the clouds away
                          F
  let the music have it's way
          Dm             C              G
  Let it steal my heart away, and you know I'm going

C              F 
  Outside the ringing 
C                      F
  the night train is bringin' me home
           C               Am                 Em
  When you hear that locomotion get ready to fly
             G                C
  Cause it's almost Saturday night

F                        C
  Gonna push the clouds away
                          C
  let the music have it's way
         Dm              C              G
  Let it steal my heart away, and you know I'm going

C              F 
  Outside the ringing 
C                      F
  the night train is bringin' me home
         C               Am                 Em
  When I hear that locomotion get ready to fly
             G               C
