Ive lived by the river all my life

Don't know nothin but toil and strife
Cant go home again cant go home again
                                   
{Refrain}

Well east and west the highway roll     
Lord have mercy on my poor soul          
I miss my blue eyed baby oh   
My pretty little blue eyed baby oh

{ReFrain}

Well that rivers deep and that rivers wide
The devil stands on every side
Can't go home again can't go home again

{Refrain}
  
That pretty little girl i live so well
She goes to Heaven Lord i go to hell
Can't go home again can't go home again
