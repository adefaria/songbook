Seems Like A long Time by Brewer & Shipley

G              Em      D
Night time is only the other side of daytime
C                                  G    D
But if you've ever waited for the sun
Em                          D                  C        D
You know what it's like to wish daytime would come and don't it
Chorus
G                       D
Seem like a long time, seem like a long time
C             D         G
Seem like a long, long time 
       C   D    G                      D
Sometimes it seems like a long time, seems like a long time
C             D           G
Seems like a long, long time
C          D               G
Yes it does, a long, long time

G               Em       D
Hard times are only the other side of good times
C                                       G   D
But if you ever wished hard times were gone
Em                          D                     C        D
You know what it's like to wish good times would come and don't it

Em                          D                     C        D

Chorus

G            Em       D
War time is only the other side of peace time
C                                    G    D
But if you've ever seen how wars are won
Em                          D                     C        D
You know what it's like to wish that peace would come and don't it
