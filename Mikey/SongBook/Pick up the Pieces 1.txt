Poco - "Pickin' Up The Pieces" 1


Chorus:
Well, there's just a li[F#]ttle bit o' magic
in the country music we're s[E]ingin'
So let's beg[B]in
We're bri[F#]ngin' ya back down home
Where the folks are ha[E]ppy
Sittin', pickin', and a-gri[B]nnin'
Casual[C#m]ly, you and [F#]me
Will pick up the p[E]ieces, u[F#]h-huh

Verse:
Somebody y[E]elled out at [F3]me
Country m[B]usic and compan[E]y
Kinda ma[G#m]kes it
On a S[E]unday aftern[F#]oon
Picnic l[E]unches of yest[F#]erday
Should still have a pl[B]ace in your heart toda[E]y
Think it o[G#m]ver
'Cause we'll [E]all be going [F#]home so s[E]oon   [B]

(Repeat Chorus)

If ya had the time to stay
Would ya sit yourself down and play
Country music
Singin' songs that we both knew
Lord, I know that the day will come
When the both of us'll sit down and strum
On our guitars
And you'll see I really am a lot like you

(Repeat chorus)
