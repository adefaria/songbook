G
Hey little girl, is you daddy home
                              C
Did he go and leave you all alone
               Em           C     D           G
I’ve got a bad desire,      Oh   I’m   on   fire

G
Tell me now baby is he good to you
                                      C
And can he do to you the things that I do
                 Em         C      D              G
I can take you higher       Oh,   I’m   on   fire

Chorus:     Sometimes it’s like someone took a knife baby,   edgy and dull

               And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull

V3:	G	
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
                                                           C                                                          C
And a freight train running through the middle of my head, only you
               Em           C         D           G
You cool my desire,       Oh,   I’m   on   fire
