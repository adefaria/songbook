{title:Walls Of Time}
Written by Bill Monroe and Peter Rowan

[G]The wind is blowing across the mountain 
And down on the valley way [C]below 
It [G]sweeps the grave of my darling 
When I [C]die that's w[D7]here I want to [G]go
  
Lord send the angels for my darling 
And take her to that home on h[C]igh
I'll [G]wait my time out here on earth love 
And [C]come to y[D7]ou when I [G]die 

I hear a voice out in the darkness 
It moans and whispers through the [C]pine 
I [G]know it's my sweetheart a calling 
I [C]hear her [D7]through the walls of t[G]ime

Lord send the angels for my darling 
And take her to that home on [C]high
I'll [G]wait my time out here on earth love 
And [C]come to [D7]you when I [G]die

Our names are carved upon a tombstone
I promised you before you [C]died 
Our [G]love will bloom forever darling 
[C]When we r[D7}est side by [G]side
  

Lord send the angels for my darling 
And take her to that home on [C]high
I'll [G]wait my time out here on earth love 
And c[C]ome to [D7]you when I [G]die
