Capo 2 

I Can Feel Your Calmness. Comin’ rolling across the hills.
I can sense your peace of mind. Leaving all those troubles behind.
It feels like somethings come over me. A 
I feel an easy sleep comin’ cross my eyes
A dream that’s comin’ true and your the reason why.
Let it all come through let it all come true


They’re all wasted energy
