{title:It Just Feels Right}
{subtitle:Rick Lecksell}


We just flew away, instead walking down the aisle
You were a beautiful site 
When you walked by, In your wedding dress
It felt like we were high, high high high by a mile
A little nervous I must confess.
Here we are miles and years away, but our love has grown over time.
And you can hear me say....

It just feels right, like our wedding night
It just feels right, like our wedding night
It just feels right, like our wedding night
