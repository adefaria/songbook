I Shall Be Released
By Bob Dylan


[Verse]
A                              Bm
 They say everything can be replaced
C#m        D        E      A     
 Yet every distance is not near
A                    Bm
 So I remember every face
C#m        D       E      A       
 Of every man who put me here.


[Chorus]
A                     Bm
 I see my light come shining
C#m        D      E      A
 From the west unto the east.
 A
  Any day now,
 Bm
  Any day now,
C#m       D      A
  I shall be released


[Verse]
A                             Bm
 They say every man needs protection.
C#m            D     E         A    
 They say that every man must fall.
A                         Bm
 Yet I swear I see my reflection,
C#m           D      E         A   
 Someplace so high above this wall.


[Chorus]
A                     Bm 
 I see my light come shining
C#m        D      E      A
 From the west unto the east.
 A
  Any day now,
 Bm
  Any day now,
C#m       D      A
  I shall be released


[Verse]
A                                 Bm
 Well yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
C#m          D          E       A   
 A man who swears he's not to blame.
A                         Bm
 All day long I hear him cry out so loud,
C#m      D          E         A
 Calling out that he's been framed.
   

[Chorus]
A                     Bm
 I see my light come shining
C#m        D      E      A
 From the west unto the east.
 A
  Any day now,
 Bm
  Any day now,
C#m       D      A
  I shall be released
