[Em]Take me back to my boat on the river. I [D]need to go down. I [B]need to come down.
[Em]Take me back to my boat on the river and [D]I won't cry out anym[Em]ore.
[Em]Time stands still as I gaze in her water. She ea[D]ses me down, tou[B]ching me gently. 
With the wa[Em]ters that flow past my boat on the river. So [D]I don't cry out an[Em]ymore.

Oh, the ri[D]ver is wise. The ri[B]ver it touches my l[Em]ife like the waves on her s[A]and.
And [Am]all roads lead to Tran[Em]quility Base.
Where the f[F#7]rown on my face disa[B]ppears.
[Em]Take me down to my boat on the river. And [D]I won't cry o[B]ut an[Em]ymore.
