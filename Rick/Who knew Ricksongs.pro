{title:Who knew}
{subtitle:Ricksongs}

You were thinking that you might get ahead
If you could only catch a break
But you looked at the cards in your hand
And things are looking pretty bleak.

You stay steady and think it's just a matter of time
And your time is going to come
So, you walk on and shake another tree
But the fruit is lomg gone and you really want some.

Who knew it would be this way, take this long.
You thought you could make it pay
But now you're singing a new song.
