{title:What's Up}
1992
Capo II

G  Am  C  G  x2

[G]Twenty-five years and my life is still

[Am]Trying to get up that great big hill

Of [C]hope for a desti[G]nation

[G]I realized quickly when I knew I should

That the [Am]world was made of this brotherhood

Of [C]man, for whatever that [G]means


[Pre-Chorus]
And so I [G]cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed

Just to [Am]get it all out, what's in my head

and I [C]- I am feeling a little pe[G]culiar

And so I [G]wake in the morning and I step outside

and I [Am]take a deep breath and I get real high and

I [C]scream at the top of my lungs "What's going [G]on?"


[Chorus]
And I said "[G]Heyeyeyeyey [Am]Heyeyey"

I said "[C]Hey, what's going [G]on?"

And I said "[G]Heyeyeyeyey [Am]Heyeyey"

I said "[C]Hey, what's going [G]on?"


[Interlude]
[G]Ooh, O[Am]oh O[C]oh [G]

[G]Ooh, O[Am]oh O[C]oh [G]


[Verse]
And I [G]try, oh my God do I [Am]try

I try all the [C]time, in this insti[G]tution

And I [G]pray, oh my god do I [Am]pray

I pray every single [C]day

For a revo[G]lution


[Pre-Chorus]
And so I [G]cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed

Just to [Am]get it all out, what's in my head

and I [C]- I am feeling a little pe[G]culiar

And so I [G]wake in the morning and I step outside

and I [Am]take a deep breath and I get real high and

I [C]scream at the top of my lungs "What's going [G]on?"


[Chorus]
And I said "[G]Heyeyeyeyey [Am]Heyeyey"

I said "[C]Hey, what's going [G]on?"

And I said "[G]Heyeyeyeyey [Am]Heyeyey"

I said "[C]Hey, what's going [G]on?"


[Chorus]
And I said "[G]Heyeyeyeyey [Am]Heyeyey"

I said "[C]Hey, what's going [G]on?"

And I said "[G]Heyeyeyeyey [Am]HeyeYEYEYE"

I said "[C]Hey, what's going [G]on?"


[Interlude]
[G]Ooh, O[Am]oh O[C]oh [G]


[Outro]
