I [G]met a gin soaked bar room queen in [C]Memphis. [Csus4] [C]
She [G]tried to take me up[A]stairs for a [D]ride. [Dsus4] [D]
She [G]had to heave me right across her [C]shoulder. [Csus4] [C]
Cause I [G]just can't seem to [D]drink ya off my [G]mind.

I [G]layed a divorcee in New York [C]City. [Csus4] [C]
I [G]had to put up some [A]kind of a [D]fight. [Dsus4] [D]
The [G]lady, then she covered me in [C]roses. [Csus4] [C]
She [G]blew my nose and [D]then she blew my [G]mind.
