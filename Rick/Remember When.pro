Remember w[A]hen,[F#m]    the so[D]und of little f[E]eet,
Was our mu[A]sic,[F#m]    we dan[D]ced from week to w[E]eek,
Brought back the l[A]ove, we found t[F#m]rust,
Vowed we'd n[D]ever give it [E]up,
Remember wh[A]en [F#m] [D] [E]

Remember w[A]hen,[F#m]    thi[D]rty seemed so o[E]ld,
Now looking b[A]ack,[F#m]    it's ju[D]st a steppin st[E]one,
To where we a[A]re, where we've [F#m]been,
Said we'd [D]do it all aga[E]in,
Remember wh[A]en [F#m] [D] [E]

Remember w[A]hen,[F#m]    we s[D]aid when we'd turn g[E]rey,
When the chi[A]ldren[F#m],    gr[D]ow up and move a[E]way,
We won't be s[A]ad, we'll be [F#m]glad,
For a[D]ll the life we've h[E]ad,
And we'll remember wh[A]en, [F#m] [D] [E]
Remember wh[A]en, [F#m] [D] [E]
Remember w[A]hen.
