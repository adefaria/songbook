{title:Death By Silence}
{subtitle:Ted Savage}

The last echoes of your laugh are fading away
The sound of your guitar is only a faint memory
There will be no more of that magic
Why did it have to be so tragic
 
Is it a curse, is it a gift
You crossed my path
And we created moments of Eternity
Floating in bliss
Words pouring like honey
Like a sweet wine
It was happy. I want it still to be.
 
Your silence is my death sentence.
