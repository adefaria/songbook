Call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load

Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
Well there ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
And I ain't hiding from nobody
Nobody's hiding from me
Oh, that's the way it's supposed to be

{c:Lead - switch}

Well, I got that green light baby
I got to keep moving on
Well, I got that green light baby
I got to keep moving on
Well, I might go out to California
Might go down to Georgia I don't know

{c:Piano solo}

{c:Everybody solo}

Well, I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
Well, now I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
But I don't love me no one woman
So I can't stay in Georgia long

Well, now they call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
Well, now they call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load

Ooh-ooh Mr. Breeze
