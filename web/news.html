<h2>Recent Changes</h2>

<p>I've made some more changes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Removed the list of songs from the front page. There were getting to be just
too many songs listed to be helpful. Instead I now have a drop down list of 
artists and songs as well as a search box. Select an artist or a song and then
select go to go to an artist page or a song page. Or search for a term. The search
will search for a word or phrase in the title, artist or in the song itself. The
search is not that bright but works fairly well.</li>

<li>There's a new artist's page which shows you all of the artists songs in one
page. Many artists have only one or a few songs. Some artists have quite a few
songs.</li>

<li>The song pages now are on auto play. If they have music assoicated with them
then their music will start playing automatically.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Past Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Changed the home icon to something much bigger. Clicking on this gets you
  back to the <a href="/songbook">Songbook home page</a>.</li>
  
  <li>Now if the song has an associated .mp3 file in the Media folder that
  <b>exactly</b> matches the song's title then a little HTML5 MP3 player will 
  appear. You can play the song while you read the words and follow the 
  chords! <b>Note:</b> You can right click and save the song's mp3 file to
  your computer. If the song does not have a corresponding .mp3 file then
  no .mp3 player is displayed. For example, <a href="http://defaria.com/songbook/webchord.cgi?chordpro=/web/songbook/Songs/Amie.pro">Amie</a>.</li>
  
  <li>Again, if the song has a corresponding .mp3 file I now re-write the .pro
  file to include {musicpath:/sdcard/SongBook/Medai/&lt<i>title</i>&gt;.mp3}. 
  This string "links" the ChordPro file with music such that (in SongBook, the
  app I use on my Android Tablet) you can play the song's mp3 file on your 
  tablet! I'm not sure if OnSong (the iPad equivalent of SongBook) does the same
  thing. If you sign up for sharing my songbook via DropBox (<a href="mailto:adefaria@gmail.com?subject=Please share your SongBook with me">send me email</a> if
  you want an invite) you should be all set.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Currently my code is very picky. The file name for the .pro file
and the .mp3 file must match <b>exactly</b> - is case sensitive, etc. If you 
have access to my songbook in DropBox and wish to add a .pro file and it's 
corresponding .mp3 file then be sure to match the names up correctly and put the
.mp3 file in the Media folder.</p>

<h2>Future Changes</h2>

<p>Here are some of the things I'm thinking of implementing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strike>I'm thinking of re-vamping the main page. Instead of listing all the 
  songs, which are getting to be a bit much, I would like to possibly make a 
  little search facility that would scan the .pro files for text matching in the
  song titles and lyrics themselves.</strike></li>

  <li>Another change I'm thinking of making is making it so that when you hover 
  over a chord a little popup happens that shows the chord's fingering. Sorta 
  like it's done over on tabs-ulitimate-guitar.com (For example: 
  <a href="http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/s/steve_miller/serenade_crd.htm">here</a>).
  Anybody know how to do that?</li>
  
  <li>Maybe a simple editor so people can edit songs directly.</li>
  
  <li>Maybe interfacing with Dropbox to display information about the last 
  person to update the songfile...</li>
</ul>
