  <h1 class="centered">Songbook/OnSong and chordpro (.pro) files</h1>
</div>

<div id="content">

<p>Rather than carry around sheets of paper for everybody, fumbling
and trying to find the right song sheet etc., you can use your
computer to help automate this process.</p>

<p>A chordpro file (signified by a .pro extension) is not a fancy file
format, but it gets the job done and is easy to edit with any editor
like notepad. You can google "chordpro" and read all about the format
if you like.</p>

<p>If you have a iPad or a Android tablet you can have all of your
songs with you wherever you go. Linked
with <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a> and everybody can
be on the same page. Worst case you have all of the music you know at
your fingertips. There are two apps, one for iPads
(<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onsong/id502344938?mt=8">OnSong</a>)
and the other for Android and PCs
(<a href="http://linkesoft.com/songbook/windows.html">Songbook</a>)
that will work with .pro file to render them nicely on your iPad or
Android tablet. And Songbook also works on your Windows PC where
you can print out copies of the songs if you inist on dealing with
paper.</p>

<p>Finally, you could go to my website and render any of the songs in
my Songbook using the web (described below).</p>

<h2>Chordpro file format</h2>

<p>You can go
to <a href="https://defaria.com/songbook/Andrew">https://defaria.com/songbook/Songs</a>
and you'll see a list of all the files in that directory, the .pro
files of the songs I have. You can click on any of them but what you
will get is an unrendered version of the .pro file. For example: If
you click on Brown Eyed Girl.pro you'll see:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
    {t:Brown Eyed Girl}
    {st:Van Morrison}
    {key:G}

    [G]Hey, where did [C]we go, da[G]ys when the ra[D]ins came
    [G]Down in the holl[C]ow, [G]playin' a ne[D]w game
    [G]Laughin' and a-s[C]ingin' hey-hey, [G]skippin' and a-j[D]umpin'
    [G]In the misty mor[C]ning fog, with o[G]ur he[D]arts thumpin and yo[C]u[D]
    My Brown-eyed gi[G]rl[Em], yo[C]u my[D] brown eyed [G]girl [D]

    [G]Hey whatever [C]happened, [G]Tuesday went [D]so slow
    [G]Goin down the [C]old mine with a [G]transistor [D]radio
    [G]Standin' in the [C]sunlight laughin', [G]hide behind the [D]rainbow's wall
    [G]Slippin' and a-[C]slidin', [G]all along the [D]waterfall with [G]you
    My Brown-eyed gi[G]rl[Em], yo[C]u my[D] brown eyed [G]girl [D]

    {soc}
    [D]Do you remember when we used to [G]sing
    Sha-la-la [C]la-la la-la [G]la-la la-la [D]de-da
    [G]Sha-la-la [C]la-la la-la [G]la-la la-la [D]de-da
    La-de-[G]da[D]
    {eoc}

    [G][Em][C][D][G][D]

    So hard to find my way, now that I'm all on my own
    Saw you just the other day, my how you have grown
    Cast my memory back there lord, sometimes I'm overcome, thinkin'bout
    Making love in the green grass, behind the stadium with you
    My brown eyed girl, you my brown eyed girl

    {soc}
    [D]Do you remember when we used to [G]sing
    Sha-la-la [C]la-la la-la [G]la-la la-la [D]de-da
    [G]Sha-la-la [C]la-la la-la [G]la-la la-la [D]de-da
    La-de-[G]da
    {eoc}

<p>You see things like {t:Brown Eyed Girl} (title) and {key:G} as well
as embedded tags for the chords ([G], [C], etc). Doesn't look as
pretty right? But when you include the webchord.cgi portion you are
running a script named webchord.cgi which reads the file from the
parameter chordpro (that's why you need the chordpro=song.pro portion)
and then reformats stuff into HTML that looks pretty, centering the
title of the song, putting the chords over the words and bolding the
text between {soc} and {eoc} (start of chorus, end of chorus). So
given the above SongTitle="Brown Eyed Girl" we can formulate the URL
to render it thusly:</p>

<blockquote><a href="https://defaria.com/songbook/webchord.cgi?chordpro=/web/songbook/Andrew/Brown Eyed Girl.pro">https://defaria.com/songbook/webchord.cgi?chordpro=/web/songbook/Songs/Brown Eyed Girl.pro</a></blockquote>

<p>You can do the same thing for the other songs there too.</p>

<p>I should just write a quick script that gets all of the .pro files
in the directory songbook/Andrew and then formulates a page of links
that have the webchord.cgi links to render them like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://defaria.com/songbook/webchord.cgi?chordpro=/web/songbook/Andrew/Across the Universe.pro">Across the Universe</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://defaria.com/songbook/webchord.cgi?chordpro=/web/songbook/Andrew/American Pie.pro">American Pie</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://defaria.com/songbook/webchord.cgi?chordpro=/web/songbook/Andrew/Amie.pro">Amie</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://defaria.com/songbook/webchord.cgi?chordpro=/web/songbook/Andrew/Back in the USSR.pro">Back in the USSR</a></li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>You have to fill in the &lt;SongTitle&gt; portion of the link. So, for
example, you take:</p>

<blockquote>
https://defaria.com/songbook/Andrew/webchord.cgi?chordpro=&lt;SongTitle&gt;.pro
</blockquote>

<p>pop it into the address bar of your browser then change &lt;SongTitle&gt;
to the title of the song you want to render:</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://defaria.com/songbook/webchord.cgi?chordpro=/web/songbook/Andrew/Amie.pro">https://defaria.com/songbook/webchord.cgi?chordpro=/web/songbook/Andrew/Amie.pro</a>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>URLs are case sensitive! ...chordpro=amie.pro is not the same as ...chordpro=Amie.pro</li>
  <li>Browsers tend to change spaces in a URL to %20. %20 is the octal representation for a space character. So if you see %20 in a URL like https://defaria.com/songbook/webchord.cgi?chordpro=/web/songbook/Songs/Back%20in%20the%20USSR.pro. Don't fear - they're merely spaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Songbook for PC</h2>

<p>You can get a Windows PC version of Songbook
at <a href="http://linkesoft.com/songbook/windows.html">http://linkesoft.com/songbook/windows.html</a>. It
will run on your PC and render songs like:</p>

<img src="songbook.jpg">

<p>It's $20 and you can even print out your stuff if you still use
paper or need paper for other people.</p>
