<p>This song was done mainly as an acoustic piece. I will attempt to 
describe some of various parts of the song that serve to make it iconic.
First it the intro with the 3rd harmonized lead lines. The rhythm part
enters next playing G and Dmaj7. While the YouTube video says to play
essentially G6 I tend to play Gmaj7. I save that for the chorus where I
can distinctly hear the open E string being played.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> The rhythm part is rhythmic! It's <b>not</b> just
strumming 4 beats of one chord and 4 of the next. There is a pattern
which entails striking the strings with a certain number of timed strikes
as well as just raking through the strings to produce a drum like noise
but not a strummed chord. Guitar, especially acoustic, is a viseral 
instrument and sometimes you need to bang on it!</p>

<p>This pattern changes for the chorus. The chords are largely the same but
this is where I hear and do the G6 chord. If you can't do that then don't
worry, just play G like you were before.</p>

<p>The chord behind "I know, oh oh, oh oh oh..." part is the familiar Dmaj7
but I play it with a downstroke on Dmaj7 and then an upstroke on the
strings but I lift my finger playing all open strings. Then I hammer back
on the Dmaj7.</p>

<p>I play the F#m as a full and regular F#m though if you can play the chord
shown in the YouTube video (essentially F#m with no F# in the bass and the
B and E strings open) that will give you an airier sound.</p>

<p>For the Do, do, do's, the pattern starts on the Dmaj7, not the G. Don't
worry if you mess this up - I do all the time. Just get back on track
as quickly as you can and smile - everybody will think you did it on
pupose!</p>

<p>The arrangement of the song is basically Intro, Verse, Chorus, Verse,
Chorus twice and end.</p>

<h3>3rd lead bits</h3>

<p>For those of you willing to try the 3rd lead bits they are covered
pretty well in the YouTube video. But to put the parts in perspective:</p>

<p>Pick either the higher harmony line or the lower one. Both are detailed.
Or learn both so that you could do either one (Boy Scouts - Be Prepared!).
I will call the first two runs as one part. This comes in and out at
various times throughout the song. Then there are the extensions which are
a note or 4 that goes up the scale. If you're playing this with sometbody
else you'll both need to know exactly where each extension is played
otherwise you'll look foolish doing your part and the other person not
following.</p>

<p>The 3rd lead part happens 4 times in the beginning. On the 5th time two
extra notes are played going up the scale. The vocals come in right after
that. Think of this first extention as a queue for the singer to start
singing.</p>

<p>The 3rd lead happens once again after "road" and this time goes up 4
notes. A regular 3rd lead lick happens again after "Joe". No notes go up. It
happens again at "snow" but goes up 2 notes.</p>

<p>After this first "I know" there's a different 3rd lead going down before
startign the chorus. This is not detailed in the YouTube video very well.
In fact he shows you only one line of the 2 that should be played. See if
you can get the notes and we'll go over this at the meetup.</p>

<p>For the Do, do, do's, which start on "in the air..." I play but I must
sing the one harmony who's note does not change. Changing harmony melody
and playing the lead is too difficult.</p>

<p>Coming out of the Do, do, do's to the next verse is tricky because if
you count it the part happens 3 times with the 4th time having the two
notes going up and thus queuing the singer. In my old bad the singer always
had a hard time with this precisely because the beginning of the song has
4 times and the 2 notes going up on the 5th time and here we have 3 times
and going up on the 4th time. The singer would always want to hear those
2 notes going up as his queue and I dutifully played those 2 notes louder
so he would hear the queue.</p>

<p>As before we have the lead with the 4 notes going up at the "early
train".</p>

<p>Other than that the chorus repeats twice and the song ends.</p>
