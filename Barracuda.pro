So this ain't the end, I saw you again, today
I had to turn my heart away
Smiled like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails

You lying so low in the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now wouldn't you, barracuda? Oh

Back over time we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me, uh-huh
No right, no wrong you're selling a song, a name
Whisper game

And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Ooh, barracuda, oh yeah

"Sell me, sell you" the porpoise said
Dive down deep now to save my head, you
I think that you got the blues too

All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools

{c:Lead}

The real thing don't do the trick, no
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Ohh, barra-barracuda, yeah
