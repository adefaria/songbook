{title:Johnny B. Goode}
{subtitle:Chuck Berry}
 [Verse] 
A Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans, 
A Way back up in the woods among the evergreens, 
D There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood 
A Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode 
E Who never ever learned to read or write so well, 
A But he could play the guitar just like a ringin' a bell. 

[Chorus] 
A Go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! 
D Go! Go, Johnny, go! A E A Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go! Johnny B. Goode 

[Verse] 
A He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack, 
A Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track. 
D Old engineers would see him sittin' in the shade, 
A Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made. 
E When people passed him by they would stop and say, 
A 'oh, my but that little country boy could play' 

[Chorus] 
A Go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! 
D Go! Go, Johnny, go! A E A Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go! Johnny B. Goode

[Verse] 
A His mother told him, 'someday you will be a man, 
A You will be the leader of a big ol' band. 
D Many people comin' from miles around 
A Will hear you play your music when the sun go down. 
E Maybe someday your name'll be in lights, 
A Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode tonight'' 

[Chorus] 
A Go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go!  Go, Johnny, go! 
D Go! Go, Johnny, go! A E A Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go! Johnny B. Goode
