[Chorus] 
C F Driving that train, high on cocaine, 
F C Casey Jones you better watch your speed. 
C F Trouble ahead, trouble behind, 
F C and you know that notion just crossed my mind. 

[Verse 1] 
C D This old engine makes it on time, 
F G Leaves central station ’bout a quarter to nine, 
C D Hits river junction at seventeen to, 
F E Am G At a quarter to ten you know it’s travlin’ again. 

[Chorus] 
C F Driving that train, high on cocaine, 
F C Casey Jones you better watch your speed. 
C F Trouble ahead, trouble behind, 
F C And you know that notion just crossed my mind. 

[Verse 2] 
C D Trouble ahead, lady in red, 
F G Take my advice you’d be better off dead. 
C D Switchman’s sleeping, train hundred and two is 
F E Am G On the wrong track and headed for you. 

[Chorus] 
C F Driving that train, high on cocaine, 
F C Casey Jones you better watch your speed. 
C F Trouble ahead, trouble behind, 
F C and you know that notion just crossed my mind.
