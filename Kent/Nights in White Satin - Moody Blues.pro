[Verse 1]
[Em]Nights in white [D]satin, [Em]never reaching the [D]end,
[C]Letters I've [G]written, [F]never meaning to [Em]send.
[Em]Beauty I've [D]always missed, [Em]with these eyes be[D]fore,
[C]Just what the [G]truth is, [F]I can't say any more [Em]

[Chorus]
'Cos I [A]love you, yes I [C]love you, oh, how I [Em]love you.[D][Em][D] 

[Verse 2]
[Em]Gazing at [D]people, [Em]some hand in [D]hand,
[C]Just what I'm [G]going through, [F]they can't under[Em]stand.
[Em]Some try to [D]tell me, [Em]thoughts they cannot [D]defend,
[C]Just what you [G]want to be, [F]you'll be in the [Em]end. 

[Chorus]
And I [A]love you, yes I [C]love you, oh, how I [Em]love you.[D][Em][D][Em]
