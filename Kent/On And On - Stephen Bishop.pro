When the[EM7] first time is the [D#m7]last time

Hold[G#m7] on [C#m7]tight, don't [F#7sus4]let her say goodnight.
(Do intro) 

[Verse]
Got the sun on my shoulders and my toes in the sand  
My woman's left me for some other man 
Ah, but I don't care, I'll just dream and stay tanned 
Toss up my heart and see where it lands. On and on
I just keep on trying 
And I smile when I feel like dying 
On and on, on and on, on and on 
On and on, on and on, on and on 
On and on, on and on, on and on Oohâ€¦
