{title:Freight Train}
{subtitle:Elizabeth Cotton}

Composed as teenager around 1910 inspired by the train track near her home in North Carolina.  It didn't get popular until her housekeeper boss took to England where it became popular in folk music circles.  A couple guys took credit for it and it was recorded by several skiffle bands including the Quarrymen (aka, The Beatles).  

Elizabeth was a self taught left handed guitarist who didn't change the string order.  Her picking style became known as "Cotten picking).
